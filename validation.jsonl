As you know by now, the five-paragraph format that most students mastered before coming to college suggests that introductory paragraphs should start very general and gradually narrow down to the thesis. (See chapter 12, \"Constructing the Thesis and Argument from the Ground Up,\" for more on the five-paragraph theme.) As a result, students frequently write introductions for college papers in which the first two or three (or more) sentences are patently obvious or overly broad. \n#### IN TODAY'S WORLD... \n A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 216 \n I started laughing when I first read this chapter because my go-to introduction for every paper was always \"Throughout history...\" In high school it was true--my first few sentences did not have any meaning. Now I understand it should be the exact opposite. Introductions should scream to your readers, HEY GUYS, READ THIS! I don't want my readers' eyes to glaze over before they even finish the first paragraph, do you? And how annoying is it to read a bunch of useless sentences anyways, right? Every sentence should be necessary, and you should set your papers with a good start. ALY BUTTON writing student Charitable and well-rested instructors just skim over that text and start reading closely when they arrive at something substantive. Frustrated and overtired instructors emit a dramatic self-pitying sigh, assuming that the whole paper will be as lifeless and gassy as those first few sentences. If you've gotten into the habit of beginning opening sentences with the following phrases, firmly resolve to strike them from your repertoire right now: In today's world... Throughout human history... Since the dawn of time... Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary defines [CONCEPT] as... For one thing, sentences that begin with the first three phrases are often wrong. For example, someone may write, \"Since the dawn of time, people have tried to increase crop yields.\" In reality, people have not been trying to increase crop yields throughout human history--agriculture is only about 23,000 years old, after all--and certainly not since the dawn of time (whenever that was). For another, sentences that start so broadly, even when factually correct, could not possibly end with anything interesting. So what should you do? Well, start at the beginning. By that I mean, start explaining what the reader needs to know to comprehend your thesis and its importance. For example, compare the following two paragraphs: Throughout time, human societies have had religion. Major world religions since the dawn of civilization include Zoroastrianism, Hinduism, Animism, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. These and all other religions provide a set of moral principles, a leadership structure, and an explanation for unknown questions such as what happens after people die. Since the dawn of religion, it has always been opposed to science because one is based on faith and the other on reason. However, the notion of embodied cognition is a place where physical phenomena connect with religious ones. Paradoxically, religion can emphasize a deep involvement in reality, an embodied cognition that empowers followers to escape from physical constraints and reach a new \n#### INTRODUCTIONS \n##### AIM FOR SPECIFIC AND LIVELY \n Five-paragraph theme version: 217 COLLECTED WORKS \nspirituality. Religion carefully constructs a physical environment to synthesize an individual's memories, emotions, and physical actions in a manner that channels the individual's cognitive state toward spiritual transcendence. Religion is an endeavor to cultivate freedom from bodily constraints to reach a higher state of being beyond the physical constraints of reality. But how is it possible to employ a system, the human body, to transcend its own limitations? Religion and science have always had an uneasy relationship, as empiricism is stretched to explain religious phenomena, but psychology has recently added a new perspective to the discussion. Embodiment describes the interaction between humans and the environment that lays a foundation for cognition and can help explain the mechanisms that underlie religion's influence on believers. This is a rare moment where science and religion are able to coexist without the familiar controversy. Paradoxically, religion can emphasize a deep involvement in reality, an embodied cognition that empowers followers to escape from physical constraints and reach a new spirituality. Religion carefully constructs a physical environment to synthesize an individual's memories, emotions, and physical actions, in a manner that channels the individual's cognitive state toward spiritual transcendence. In the first version, the first three sentences state well-known facts that do not directly relate to the thesis. The fourth sentence is where the action starts, though that sentence (\"Since the dawn of religion, it has always been opposed to science because one is based on faith and the other on reason\") is still overstated: When was this dawn of religion? And was there \"science,\" as we now understand it, at that time? The reader has to slog through to the fifth sentence before the intro starts to develop some momentum. Training in the five-paragraph theme format seems to have convinced some student writers that beginning with substantive material will be too abrupt for the reader. But the second example shows that a meatier beginning isn't jarring; it is actually much more engaging. The first sentence of the organic example is somewhat general, but it specifies the particular aspect of religion (transcending physical experience) that is germane to the thesis. The next six sentences lay out the ideas and concepts that explain the thesis, which is provided in the last two sentences. Overall, every sentence is needed to thoroughly frame the thesis. It is a lively paragraph in itself, and it piques the reader's interest in the author's original thinking about religion. Sometimes a vague introductory paragraph reflects a simple, obvious thesis and a poorly thought-out paper. More often, though, a shallow introduction represents a missed opportunity to convey the writer's depth of thought from the get-go. Students adhering to the fiveparagraph theme format sometimes assume that such vagueness is needed to bookend an otherwise pithy paper. As you can see from these examples, that is simply untrue. I've seen some student writers begin with a vague, high school-style intro (thinking it obligatory) and then write a wonderfully vivid and engaging introduction as their second paragraph. Other papers I've seen have an interesting, original thesis embedded in late body paragraphs that should be articulated up front and used to shape the whole body. If you must write a vague \"Since the dawn of time\" intro to get the writing process going, then go ahead. Just budget the time to rewrite the intro around your well-developed, arguable thesis and ensure that the body paragraphs are organized explicitly by your analytical thread. Organically structured version: A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 218 \nHere are two more examples of excellent introductory paragraphs written by undergraduate students in different fields. Note how, in both cases, (1) the first sentence has real substance, (2) every sentence is indispensable to setting up the thesis, and (3) the thesis is complex and somewhat surprising. Both of these introductory paragraphs set an ambitious agenda for the paper. As a reader, it's pretty easy to imagine how the body paragraphs that follow will progress through the nuanced analysis needed to carry out the thesis. He rebelled against his teacher, formed his own rival school, engaged in a passionate affair with a teenager, was castrated, and became a monk. All in a day's work. Perhaps it's no surprise that Peter Abelard gained the title of \"heretic\" along the way. A twelfth-century philosopher and theologian, Abelard tended to alienate nearly everyone he met with his extremely arrogant and egotistical personality. This very flaw is what led him to start preaching to students that he had stolen from his former master, which further deteriorated his reputation. Yet despite all of the senseless things that he did, his teachings did not differ much from Christian doctrine. Although the church claimed to have branded Abelard a heretic purely because of his religious views, the other underlying reasons for these accusations involve his conceited personality, his relationship with the fourteen-year-old Heloise, and the political forces of the twelfth century. Bacterial resistance to antibiotics is causing a crisis in modern health care. The evolution of multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus is of particular concern because of the morbidity and mortality it causes, the limited treatment options it poses, and the difficulty in implementing containment measures for its control. In order to appreciate the virulence of S. aureus and to help alleviate the problems its resistance is causing, it is important to study the evolution of antibiotic resistance in this pathogen, the mechanisms of its resistance, and the factors that may limit or counteract its evolution. It is especially important to examine how human actions are causing evolutionary changes in this bacterial species. This review will examine the historical sequence of causation that has led to antibiotic resistance in this microorganism and why natural selection favors the resistant trait. It is the goal of this review to illuminate the scope of the problem produced by antibiotic resistance in S. aureus and to illustrate the need for judicious antibiotic usage to prevent this pathogen from evolving further pathogenicity and virulence. If vague introductory paragraphs are bad, why were you taught them? In essence, you were taught the form so that you could later use it to deepen your thinking. By producing the five-paragraph theme over and over, it has probably become second nature for you to find a clear thesis and shape the intro paragraph around it, tasks you absolutely must accomplish in academic writing. However, you've probably been taught to proceed from \"general\" to \"specific\" in your intro and encouraged to think of \"general\" as \"vague.\" At the college level, think of \"general\" as context: begin by explaining the conceptual, historical, or factual context that the reader needs in order to grasp the significance of the argument to come. It's not so much a structure of general-to-specific; instead, it's context-to-argument.

How many different finishes are possible to the tournament? \nIn this case, we want to know how many different orderings of golfers there are, but it turns out that past tenth place, we don't care what order they finished in. All that matters is the first ten places. If the top ten are 1.Tiger, 2.Phil, 3.Lee, 4.Rory,... , and \n152 CHAPTER 6. COUNTING \n10.Bubba, then it doesn't matter whether Jason finished 11 th^ or 45 th. \nIt's easy to see that there are 45 possible winners, then for each winner there are 44 possible second-placers, _etc._ , so that this total turns out to be: \n45 x 44 x 43 x 42 x 41 x 40 x 39 x 38 x 37 x36 = 11,576,551,623,436,800 finishes. \nEach of the finishes is called a **partial permutation**. It's a permutation of k items chosen from n total, and is denoted pn,k. The number of such permutations works out to \n n x (n - 1) x (n - 2) x * * * x (n - k + 1). \nThe \"n - k + 1\" bit can be confusing, so take your time and think it through. For the golf tournament case, our highest term was 45 and our lowest term was 36. This is because n was 45 and k was 10, and so we only wanted to carry out the multiplication to 36 (not 35), and 36 is 45-10+1. \nThis can be expressed more compactly in a few different ways. First, we can use factorials to represent it: \n n x (n - 1) x (n - 2) x * * * x (n - k + 1) \n = \n n x (n - 1) x (n - 2) x * * * x 1 (n - k) x (n - k - 1) x (n - k - 2) x * * * x 1 \n = n! (n - k)! Also, we could use our compact product notation: \n n x (n - 1) x (n - 2) x * * * x (n - k + 1) = \n k- 1 \n i=0 \n (n - i). \nFinally, as with (non-partial) permutations, this comes up so much that the professionals have invented a special notation for it. It looks like a power, but has an underline under the exponent: \n n x (n - 1) x (n - 2) x * * * x (n - k + 1) = nk. \n6.2. PERMUTATIONS 153 \nThis is pronounced \"n-to-the-k-falling,\" and was invented by one of the most brilliant computer scientists in history, Donald Knuth. \nTo keep straight what nk^ means, think of it as the same as plain exponentiation, except that the product diminishes instead of staying the same. For example, \"17-to-the6 th\" is \n 176 = 17 * 17 * 17 * 17 * 17 * 17 \nbut \"17-to-the6 th-falling\" is \n 176 = 17 * 16 * 15 * 14 * 13 * 12. \nIn both cases, you're multiplying the same number of terms, it's just that in the second case, these terms are \"falling.\" \nAnyway, notation aside, partial permutations abound in practice. A late night movie channel might show four classic films back to back every evening. If there are 500 films in the studio's library, how many nightly TV schedules are possible? Answer: 5004 , since there are 500 choices of what to show at 7pm, then 499 choices for 9pm, 498 for 11pm, and 497 for the 1am late show. \nThe fastest 41 auto racers will qualify for Sunday's race, and will be placed from Pole Position on down depending on their qualifying time. If 60 cars participate in the qualifying heat, then there are 6041 different possible starting configurations for Sunday. \nMiddle schoolers entering sixth grade will be assigned a semester schedule that consists of five \"blocks\" (periods), each of which will have one of thirteen classes (science, math, orchestra, study hall, _etc._ ) How many schedules are possible? You guessed it, 135. Notice that this is the correct answer only because no repeats are allowed: we don't want to schedule any student for American History more than once. If a student _could_ take the same class more than once in a day, then there would be 135 (not \"falling\") different possible schedules. \n154 CHAPTER 6. COUNTING \n**6.3 Combinations** \nAll the stuff with permutations has emphasized _order_. Somebody gets first place in the golf tournament, and somebody else gets second, and you bet your bottom dollar that it matters which is which. What if it turns out we don't care about the order, though? Maybe we don't care who got what place, but just _which_ golfers were in the top ten. Maybe we don't care which film is showing in which time slot, but only _which_ films are in tonight's movie lineup. \nThis counting scenario involves something called _combinations_ rather than permutations. A **combination** of k objects out of a possible n is a choice of any set of k of them, without regard to order. For instance, suppose all three Davies kids want to play on the Wii, but only two can play at a time. Who will get to play first after school? One possibility is Lizzy and T.J., another is Lizzy and Johnny, and the last one is T.J. and Johnny. These are the three (and only three) combinations of 2 objects out of 3. \nTo see how to count these in general, let's return to the golf tournament example. Suppose that in addition to winning money, the top three finishers of our local tournament will also advance to the regional tournament. This is a great honor, and brings with it far greater additional winning potential than the local money did. Question: how many different possible trios might we send to regional competition? \nAt first glance, this seems just like the \"how many prize money allocations\" problem from before, except that we're taking 3 instead of 10. But there is a twist. In the former problem, it mattered who was first vs. second vs. third. Now _the order is irrelevant._ If you finish in the top three, you advance, period. You don't \"advance more forcefully\" for finishing first locally instead of third. \nIt's not as obvious how to count this, but of course there is a trick. The trick is to count the partial permutations, _but then realize how much we overcounted, and then compensate for it accordingly._ \nIf we count the partial permutations of 3 out of 45 golfers, we have 453 such permutations. One of those partial permutations is: \n6.3. COMBINATIONS 155 \n 1.Phil 2.Bubba 3.Tiger \nAnother one is: \n 1.Phil 2.Tiger 3.Bubba \nand yet another is: \n 1.Tiger 2.Phil 3.Bubba \nNow the important thing to recognize is that in our present problem -- counting the possible number of regional-bound golf trios -- all three of these _different_ partial permutations represent the _same_ combination. In all three cases, it's Bubba, Phil, and Tiger who will represent our local golf association in the regional competition. So by counting all three of them as separate partial permutations, we've overcounted the combinations. \nObviously we want to count Bubba/Phil/Tiger only once. Okay then. How many times did we overcount it when we counted partial permutations? The answer is that we counted this trio _once for every way it can be permuted._ The three permutations, above, were examples of this, and so are these three: \n 1.Tiger 2.Bubba 3.Phil 1.Bubba 2.Tiger 3.Phil 1.Bubba 2.Phil 3.Tiger \nThis makes a total of six times that we (redundantly) counted the same combination when we counted the partial permutations. Why 6? Because that's the value of 3!, of course. There are 3! different ways to arrange Bubba, Phil, and Tiger, since that's just a straight permutation of three elements. And so we find that every threesome we want to account for, we have counted 6 times. \nThe way to get the correct answer, then, is obviously to correct for this overcounting by dividing by 6: \n 453 3! = 45 x 44 x 43 6 = 14,190 different threesomes. \n156 CHAPTER 6. COUNTING \nAnd in general, that's all we have to do. To find the number of combinations of k things taken from a total of n things we have: \n nk k! = \n n! (n - k)!k! \n combinations. \nThis pattern, too, comes up so often that mathematicians have invented (yet) another special notation for it. It looks a bit strange at first, almost like a fraction without a horizontal bar: \n ( n k \n ) = n! (n - k)!k! . \nThis is pronounced \"n-choose-k\". \nAgain, examples abound. How many different 5-card poker hands are there? Answer: \n ( 52 5 \n) , since it doesn't matter what order you're dealt the cards, only which five cards you get. If there are 1024 sectors on our disk, but only 256 cache blocks in memory to hold them, how many different combinations of sectors can be in memory at one time? \n ( 1024 256 \n ) \n. If we want to choose 4 or 5 of our top 10 customers to participate in a focus group, how many different combinations of participants could we have? \n ( 10 4 \n ) + \n ( 10 5 \n) , since we want the number of ways to pick 4 of them plus the number of ways to pick 5 of them. And for our late night movie channel, of course, there are \n ( 500 4 \n) possible movie lineups to attract audiences, if we don't care which film is aired at which time. \n**Binomial coefficients** \nThe \"n-choose-k\" notation \n (n k \n) has another name: values of this sort are called **binomial coefficients**. This is because one way to generate them, believe it or not, is to repeatedly multiply a binomial times itself (or, equivalently, take a binomial to a power.) \nA binomial, recall, is a polynomial with just two terms: \n x + y. \n6.3. COMBINATIONS 157 \nThe coefficients for this binomial are of course 1 and 1, since \"x\" really means \" 1 * x.\" Now if we multiply this by itself, we get: \n (x + y) * (x + y) = x^2 + 2xy + y^2 , \nthe coefficients of the terms being 1, 2, and 1. We do it again: \n (x^2 + 2xy + y^2 ) * (x + y) = x^3 + 3x^2 y + 3xy^2 + y^3 \nto get 1, 3, 3, and 1, and do it again: \n(x^3 + 3x^2 y + 3xy^2 + y^3 ) * (x + y) = x^4 + 4x^3 y + 6x^2 y^2 + 4xy^3 + y^4 \nto get 1, 4, 6, 4, and 1. At this point you might be having flashbacks to Pascal's triangle, which perhaps you learned about in grade school, in which each entry in a row is the sum of the two entries immediately above it (to the left and right), as in Figure 6.1. (If you never learned that, don't worry about it.) \n 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 3 3 1 1 4 6 4 1 1 5 10 10 5 1 \n Figure 6.1: The first six rows of Pascal's triangle. \nNow you might be wondering where I'm going with this. What do fun algebra tricks have to do with counting combinations of items? The answer is that the values of \n (n k \n) are _precisely the coefficients of these multiplied polynomials._ Let n be 4, which corresponds to the last polynomial </passage>"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<tool_call>\\n{\"arguments\": {\"queries\": ['In what other real-world scenarios might partial permutations be applicable besides the examples given in the document?', 'How can the concept of combinations be applied to solve different types of counting problems?', 'Can you think of any limitations or drawbacks to using the \"n-choose-k\" notation for binomial coefficients?'], \"name\": \"ExpertQAExtractor\"}}\\n</tool_call>"}]}

By playing on the audience's feelings, writers can increase the impact of their arguments. There are two especially effective techniques for cultivating pathos: \n**1.** **_Make the audience aware of the issue's relevance to them specifically_** --\"How     would you feel if this happened to you? What are we to do about this issue?\" \n**2.** **_Tell stories._** A story about one person or one community can have a deeper     impact than broad, impersonal data or abstract, hypothetical statements. Consider the difference between \"About 1.5 million pets are euthanized each year\" and \"Scooter, an energetic and loving former service dog with curly brown hair like a Brillo pad, was put down yesterday.\" Both are impactful, but the latter is more memorable and more specific. Pathos is ubiquitous in our current journalistic practices because people are more likely to act (or at least consume media) when they feel emotionally moved. Consider, as an example, the outpouring of support for detained immigrants in June 2018, reacting to the Trump administration's controversial family separation policy. As stories and images surfaced, millions of dollars were raised in a matter of days on the premise of pathos, resulting in the temporary suspension of that policy. Your argument wouldn't be complete without an appeal to ethos. Cultivating ethos refers to the means by which you demonstrate your authority or expertise on a topic. You'll have to show your audience that you're trustworthy if they are going to buy your argument. There are a handful of ways to demonstrate ethos: Although your lived experience might not set hard-and-fast rules about the world, it is worth noting that you may be an expert on certain facets of your life. For instance, a student who has played rugby for fifteen years of their life is in many ways an authority on the sport. Professional achievements demonstrate ethos by revealing status in a certain field or discipline. The common expression is \"Stand on the shoulders of giants.\" You can develop ethos by pointing to other people with authority and saying, \"Look, this smart/ experienced/qualified/important person agrees with me.\" A common misconception is that ethos corresponds with \"ethics.\" However, you can remember that ethos is about credibility because it shares a root with \"authority.\" \n#### ETHOS \n##### By personal experience \n##### By education or other certifications \n##### By citing other experts \n 45 COLLECTED WORKS \n \"Good\" argumentation depends largely on your place in time, space, and culture. Different cultures throughout the world value the elements of argumentation differently, and argument has different purposes in different contexts. The content of your argument and your strategies for delivering it will change in every unique rhetorical situation. Continuing from logos, pathos, and ethos, the notion of kairos speaks to this concern. To put it in plain language, kairos is the force that determines what will be the best argumentative approach in the moment in which you're arguing; it is closely aligned with rhetorical occasion. According to rhetoricians, the characteristics of the kairos determine the balance and application of logos, pathos, and ethos. Moreover, your sociohistorical context will bear on what you can assume of your audience. What can you take for granted that your audience knows and believes? The \"common sense\" that your audience relies on is always changing: common sense in the US in 1950 was much different from common sense in the US in 1920 or common sense in the US in 2022. You can make assumptions about your audience's interests, values, and background knowledge, but only with careful consideration of the time and place in which you are arguing. As an example, let's consider the principle of logical noncontradiction. Put simply, this means that for an argument to be valid, its logical premises must not contradict each other: if A = B, then B = A. If I said that a dog is a mammal and a mammal is an animal, but a dog is not an animal, I would be contradicting myself. Or \"No one drives on I-84; there's too much traffic.\" This statement contradicts itself, which makes it humorous to us. However, this principle of noncontradiction is not universal. Our understanding of cause and effect and logical consistency is defined by the millennia of knowledge that has been produced before us, and some cultures value the contradiction rather than perceive it as invalid. This is not to say that either way of seeing the world is more or less accurate but rather to emphasize that your methods of argumentation depend tremendously on sociohistorical context.

A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 48 \n###### CHAPTER 7. \n## SITUATING ARGUMENTS \n###### KRISTY KELLY \n Arguments are all about context, and they're designed for and by people. People have conflicting motivations, complicated views, wide varieties of values, and ideological commitments, and they carry assumptions, both examined and unexamined, that shape their receptivity toward a particular argument. If you are going to persuade anyone, you need to understand as much as you can about those values, motivations, and assumptions before you can get them to listen to you, let alone act based on your argument. Let's look at an example. Let's say you've just moved into an apartment with three new roommates who've already lived together for a year before you moved in. Since you're new to the living situation, you'd want to take some time to understand their preferences, routines, and opinions before you started making changes around the apartment. You certainly wouldn't get a cat before realizing that one of your new roommates has a cat allergy--or if you did, it would be pretty rude. But more subtly than that, you'd need to understand the internal dynamics of the roommate situation before you influence it yourself. Take a smaller example. Maybe your roommates have a friend that comes over frequently but acts really obnoxious in your opinion. They're loud, they leave a mess, and they rely on your roommates to pay for food and drinks without making a contribution themselves. You want to convince your roommates to stop inviting this person over so frequently, and you start the conversation by saying, \"Hey, that one friend of yours is really disruptive and rude every time they come over. Can you stop bringing them here, or at least run it past me before they come over?\" You think you're being reasonable with this request, but one of your roommates gives you a look of shock and says, \"What are you talking about? That person is the best\"; the other roommate goes silent; and the third roommate storms out of the room. You're baffled. Your roommates become awkward around you until you finally pull the first roommate aside and ask, \"What's the deal? Why did everyone react like that?\" You then learn that this friend helped your roommate who stormed out of the room through an incredibly tough time back in high school, to the point that they may never have even made it to college without this friend. The friend then went through some really big struggles themselves and had to start some medications that make their behavior really uneven--causing them to act a little strange when they visit the apartment. You feel a little bit sheepish about your attitude from before, realizing that this all makes a lot of sense now that you know the full context. 49 A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT \nLike we said before: rhetoric is all about **context.** You can't have a decent conversation, let alone persuade someone, if you don't understand the various motivations, connections, and implicit values driving the situation you're stepping into. So that's what a good rhetorician does--they try to understand the internal dynamics of the audience she hopes to influence. You probably understand this on an instinctual level. We use this kind of sensitivity to navigate complicated situations with our friends, families, and coworkers all the time. But you may not have applied this sort of thinking to the writing you've done in academic settings. This book is here to help you situate your arguments in academic conversations, just as you would situate your arguments in social settings where you know all the stakeholders involved. \"So wait--you're saying I have to understand a person's deepest values and moral commitments before I can persuade them? How can I do that if I don't even know the people I'm talking to?\" That may sound like mind reading at best and manipulation at worst. But it's really about respect and ethical argumentation. The best rhetorician listens before she argues. According to Krista Ratcliffe, listening is one of the most important elements of successful communication, particularly when it takes place across cultures or in contexts when the participants might be at odds with one another (196). Actually _listening_ to someone else is hard work. So often we're just looking for ways to shut the other person down or bolster our own viewpoints or we're merely waiting for our turn to speak. But good rhetoric doesn't work that way because it's all about taking the time to understand the audience's values and shape the argument around them rather than merely learning enough about a group of people in order to influence their views. Rhetoricians use the term _presuppositions_ to describe those tacit values that lay the foundations for arguments. Understanding the audience's presuppositions is a prerequisite to effective argumentation. Mark Longaker and Jeffrey Walker call presuppositions \"the system of ideas--the ways of thinking--that the speaker and audience share, making them a community (more or less)\" (14). Presuppositions involve what both the speaker and audience \"love, hate, fear, admire, yearn for; their sense of what is true...what they know as 'fact,' their sense of the structure of reality\"--in other words, the network of beliefs that determines how they see the world (14). Note that the speaker and audience _share_ these values in this definition. It's not enough to pander to your audience, pretending that you believe in something you don't in order to get them to see your way of thinking. This is about arguing from the same playing field so that everyone shares the same rules and sense of what they're aiming for. Here's a classic example: in _A Modest Proposal,_ Jonathan Swift expresses his outrage about the inhumane treatment of impoverished Irish by making a satirical argument for his fellow citizens to enact a program to eat the poor's newborn babies (and worse) to solve the country's economic problems. Swift makes an exaggerated, ironic claim to highlight the folly of his audience's biases and beliefs, and by making his outrageous proposal seem calmly logical, well cited, and persuasive, he beguiles his audience into confronting their own hypocrisy. Not eating babies is one of the audience's latent beliefs about what is right, and Swift uses that shared value to force his audience to see how their _other_ latent beliefs (in this case, tacit acceptance of inhumane treatment of their country's less well-off) are not only wrong but immoral. That's a rather extreme example, but we can see how it applies to the roommate example as well. The roommates share a respect for the history that shapes the visiting friend's behavior, operating on the implicit assumption that it's worth tolerating some of the friend's less-thanideal qualities in recognition of that history. This reveals some of the group's deeper beliefs A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 50 \n about the reciprocal nature of friendship and the importance of mutual support. You likely believe in those ideals, too, but your initial argument wasn't effective because it didn't recognize that those beliefs were in play. For Longaker and Walker, \"Presuppositions determine not only what the speaker means and what the audience understands; they also determine both the speaker's and the audience's understanding of the occasion\" (14). Now that you understand what's really at issue regarding the visiting friend's behavior, you're in a much better position to make arguments that resonate with the presuppositions you all share about friendship. In the quote above, Longaker and Walker say that the speaker and audience become a \"community\" when they're engaging with arguments based on shared beliefs. It turns out that we're all members of beliefs-based communities and that we're shifting between these groups all the time in our day-to-day lives </passage>"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<tool_call>\\n{\"arguments\": {\"queries\": ['How can understanding the sociohistorical context of an argument aid in persuasion?', \"What are some potential challenges in attempting to understand an audience's presuppositions?\", \"How can understanding an audience's values and beliefs help in crafting effective arguments?\"], \"name\": \"ExpertQAExtractor\"}}\\n</tool_call>"}]}

As you know by now, the five-paragraph format that most students mastered before coming to college suggests that introductory paragraphs should start very general and gradually narrow down to the thesis. (See chapter 12, \"Constructing the Thesis and Argument from the Ground Up,\" for more on the five-paragraph theme.) As a result, students frequently write introductions for college papers in which the first two or three (or more) sentences are patently obvious or overly broad. \n#### IN TODAY'S WORLD... \n A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 216 \n I started laughing when I first read this chapter because my go-to introduction for every paper was always \"Throughout history...\" In high school it was true--my first few sentences did not have any meaning. Now I understand it should be the exact opposite. Introductions should scream to your readers, HEY GUYS, READ THIS! I don't want my readers' eyes to glaze over before they even finish the first paragraph, do you? And how annoying is it to read a bunch of useless sentences anyways, right? Every sentence should be necessary, and you should set your papers with a good start. ALY BUTTON writing student Charitable and well-rested instructors just skim over that text and start reading closely when they arrive at something substantive. Frustrated and overtired instructors emit a dramatic self-pitying sigh, assuming that the whole paper will be as lifeless and gassy as those first few sentences. If you've gotten into the habit of beginning opening sentences with the following phrases, firmly resolve to strike them from your repertoire right now: In today's world... Throughout human history... Since the dawn of time... Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary defines [CONCEPT] as... For one thing, sentences that begin with the first three phrases are often wrong. For example, someone may write, \"Since the dawn of time, people have tried to increase crop yields.\" In reality, people have not been trying to increase crop yields throughout human history--agriculture is only about 23,000 years old, after all--and certainly not since the dawn of time (whenever that was). For another, sentences that start so broadly, even when factually correct, could not possibly end with anything interesting. So what should you do? Well, start at the beginning. By that I mean, start explaining what the reader needs to know to comprehend your thesis and its importance. For example, compare the following two paragraphs: Throughout time, human societies have had religion. Major world religions since the dawn of civilization include Zoroastrianism, Hinduism, Animism, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. These and all other religions provide a set of moral principles, a leadership structure, and an explanation for unknown questions such as what happens after people die. Since the dawn of religion, it has always been opposed to science because one is based on faith and the other on reason. However, the notion of embodied cognition is a place where physical phenomena connect with religious ones. Paradoxically, religion can emphasize a deep involvement in reality, an embodied cognition that empowers followers to escape from physical constraints and reach a new \n#### INTRODUCTIONS \n##### AIM FOR SPECIFIC AND LIVELY \n Five-paragraph theme version: 217 COLLECTED WORKS \nspirituality. Religion carefully constructs a physical environment to synthesize an individual's memories, emotions, and physical actions in a manner that channels the individual's cognitive state toward spiritual transcendence. Religion is an endeavor to cultivate freedom from bodily constraints to reach a higher state of being beyond the physical constraints of reality. But how is it possible to employ a system, the human body, to transcend its own limitations? Religion and science have always had an uneasy relationship, as empiricism is stretched to explain religious phenomena, but psychology has recently added a new perspective to the discussion. Embodiment describes the interaction between humans and the environment that lays a foundation for cognition and can help explain the mechanisms that underlie religion's influence on believers. This is a rare moment where science and religion are able to coexist without the familiar controversy. Paradoxically, religion can emphasize a deep involvement in reality, an embodied cognition that empowers followers to escape from physical constraints and reach a new spirituality. Religion carefully constructs a physical environment to synthesize an individual's memories, emotions, and physical actions, in a manner that channels the individual's cognitive state toward spiritual transcendence. In the first version, the first three sentences state well-known facts that do not directly relate to the thesis. The fourth sentence is where the action starts, though that sentence (\"Since the dawn of religion, it has always been opposed to science because one is based on faith and the other on reason\") is still overstated: When was this dawn of religion? And was there \"science,\" as we now understand it, at that time? The reader has to slog through to the fifth sentence before the intro starts to develop some momentum. Training in the five-paragraph theme format seems to have convinced some student writers that beginning with substantive material will be too abrupt for the reader. But the second example shows that a meatier beginning isn't jarring; it is actually much more engaging. The first sentence of the organic example is somewhat general, but it specifies the particular aspect of religion (transcending physical experience) that is germane to the thesis. The next six sentences lay out the ideas and concepts that explain the thesis, which is provided in the last two sentences. Overall, every sentence is needed to thoroughly frame the thesis. It is a lively paragraph in itself, and it piques the reader's interest in the author's original thinking about religion. Sometimes a vague introductory paragraph reflects a simple, obvious thesis and a poorly thought-out paper. More often, though, a shallow introduction represents a missed opportunity to convey the writer's depth of thought from the get-go. Students adhering to the fiveparagraph theme format sometimes assume that such vagueness is needed to bookend an otherwise pithy paper. As you can see from these examples, that is simply untrue. I've seen some student writers begin with a vague, high school-style intro (thinking it obligatory) and then write a wonderfully vivid and engaging introduction as their second paragraph. Other papers I've seen have an interesting, original thesis embedded in late body paragraphs that should be articulated up front and used to shape the whole body. If you must write a vague \"Since the dawn of time\" intro to get the writing process going, then go ahead. Just budget the time to rewrite the intro around your well-developed, arguable thesis and ensure that the body paragraphs are organized explicitly by your analytical thread. Organically structured version: A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 218 \nHere are two more examples of excellent introductory paragraphs written by undergraduate students in different fields. Note how, in both cases, (1) the first sentence has real substance, (2) every sentence is indispensable to setting up the thesis, and (3) the thesis is complex and somewhat surprising. Both of these introductory paragraphs set an ambitious agenda for the paper. As a reader, it's pretty easy to imagine how the body paragraphs that follow will progress through the nuanced analysis needed to carry out the thesis. He rebelled against his teacher, formed his own rival school, engaged in a passionate affair with a teenager, was castrated, and became a monk. All in a day's work. Perhaps it's no surprise that Peter Abelard gained the title of \"heretic\" along the way. A twelfth-century philosopher and theologian, Abelard tended to alienate nearly everyone he met with his extremely arrogant and egotistical personality. This very flaw is what led him to start preaching to students that he had stolen from his former master, which further deteriorated his reputation. Yet despite all of the senseless things that he did, his teachings did not differ much from Christian doctrine. Although the church claimed to have branded Abelard a heretic purely because of his religious views, the other underlying reasons for these accusations involve his conceited personality, his relationship with the fourteen-year-old Heloise, and the political forces of the twelfth century. Bacterial resistance to antibiotics is causing a crisis in modern health care. The evolution of multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus is of particular concern because of the morbidity and mortality it causes, the limited treatment options it poses, and the difficulty in implementing containment measures for its control. In order to appreciate the virulence of S. aureus and to help alleviate the problems its resistance is causing, it is important to study the evolution of antibiotic resistance in this pathogen, the mechanisms of its resistance, and the factors that may limit or counteract its evolution. It is especially important to examine how human actions are causing evolutionary changes in this bacterial species. This review will examine the historical sequence of causation that has led to antibiotic resistance in this microorganism and why natural selection favors the resistant trait. It is the goal of this review to illuminate the scope of the problem produced by antibiotic resistance in S. aureus and to illustrate the need for judicious antibiotic usage to prevent this pathogen from evolving further pathogenicity and virulence. If vague introductory paragraphs are bad, why were you taught them? In essence, you were taught the form so that you could later use it to deepen your thinking. By producing the five-paragraph theme over and over, it has probably become second nature for you to find a clear thesis and shape the intro paragraph around it, tasks you absolutely must accomplish in academic writing. However, you've probably been taught to proceed from \"general\" to \"specific\" in your intro and encouraged to think of \"general\" as \"vague.\" At the college level, think of \"general\" as context: begin by explaining the conceptual, historical, or factual context that the reader needs in order to grasp the significance of the argument to come. It's not so much a structure of general-to-specific; instead, it's context-to-argument.

In other words, how does the third statement of the theorem read when a = 0? Does our proof require some extra care when a = 0? Compare your answers with the similar situation for the second row operation. (See Exercise SSLE.T20.) \n \u0004 \nTheorem EOPSS is the necessary tool to complete our strategy for solving systems of equations. We will use equation operations to move from one system to another, all the while keeping the solution set the same. With the right sequence of operations, we will arrive at a simpler equation to solve. The next two examples illustrate this idea, while saving some of the details for later. Example US Three equations, one solution We solve the following system by a sequence of equation operations. \n x 1 + 2x 2 + 2x 3 = 4 x 1 + 3x 2 + 3x 3 = 5 2 x 1 + 6x 2 + 5x 3 = 6 \n a = -1 times equation 1, add to equation 2: \n x 1 + 2x 2 + 2x 3 = 4 0 x 1 + 1x 2 + 1x 3 = 1 \n SSS S L E B e e z e r : A F i r s t C o u r s e i n L i n e a r A l g e b r a 13 \n 2 x 1 + 6x 2 + 5x 3 = 6 \n a = -2 times equation 1, add to equation 3: \n x 1 + 2x 2 + 2x 3 = 4 0 x 1 + 1x 2 + 1x 3 = 1 0 x 1 + 2x 2 + 1x 3 = - 2 \n a = -2 times equation 2, add to equation 3: \n x 1 + 2x 2 + 2x 3 = 4 0 x 1 + 1x 2 + 1x 3 = 1 0 x 1 + 0x 2 - 1 x 3 = - 4 \n a = -1 times equation 3: \n x 1 + 2x 2 + 2x 3 = 4 0 x 1 + 1x 2 + 1x 3 = 1 0 x 1 + 0x 2 + 1x 3 = 4 \n which can be written more clearly as \nx 1 + 2x 2 + 2x 3 = 4 x 2 + x 3 = 1 x 3 = 4 This is now a very easy system of equations to solve. The third equation requires that x 3 = 4 to be true. Making this substitution into equation 2 we arrive at x 2 = -3, and finally, substituting these values of x 2 and x 3 into the first equation, we find that x 1 = 2. Note too that this is the only solution to this final system of equations, since we were forced to choose these values to make the equations true. Since we performed equation operations on each system to obtain the next one in the list, all of the systems listed here are all equivalent to each other by Theorem EOPSS. Thus (x 1 , x 2 , x 3 ) = (2, - 3 , 4) is the unique solution to the original system of equations (and all of the other intermediate systems of equations listed as we transformed one into another). 4 Example IS Three equations, infinitely many solutions The following system of equations made an appearance earlier in this section (Example NSE), where we listed one of its solutions. Now, we will try to find all of the solutions to this system. Do not concern yourself too much about why we choose this particular sequence of equation operations, just believe that the work we do is all correct. x 1 + 2x 2 + 0x 3 + x 4 = 7 x 1 + x 2 + x 3 - x 4 = 3 3 x 1 + x 2 + 5x 3 - 7 x 4 = 1 \n a = -1 times equation 1, add to equation 2: \n x 1 + 2x 2 + 0x 3 + x 4 = 7 0 x 1 - x 2 + x 3 - 2 x 4 = - 4 3 x 1 + x 2 + 5x 3 - 7 x 4 = 1 \n a = -3 times equation 1, add to equation 3: \n x 1 + 2x 2 + 0x 3 + x 4 = 7 \nSSS S L E B e e z e r : A F i r s t C o u r s e i n L i n e a r A l g e b r a 14 \n 0 x 1 - x 2 + x 3 - 2 x 4 = - 4 0 x 1 - 5 x 2 + 5x 3 - 10 x 4 = - 20 \na = -5 times equation 2, add to equation 3: \n x 1 + 2x 2 + 0x 3 + x 4 = 7 0 x 1 - x 2 + x 3 - 2 x 4 = - 4 0 x 1 + 0x 2 + 0x 3 + 0x 4 = 0 \na = -1 times equation 2: \n x 1 + 2x 2 + 0x 3 + x 4 = 7 0 x 1 + x 2 - x 3 + 2x 4 = 4 0 x 1 + 0x 2 + 0x 3 + 0x 4 = 0 \na = -2 times equation 2, add to equation 1: \n x 1 + 0x 2 + 2x 3 - 3 x 4 = - 1 0 x 1 + x 2 - x 3 + 2x 4 = 4 0 x 1 + 0x 2 + 0x 3 + 0x 4 = 0 \nwhich can be written more clearly as \nx 1 + 2x 3 - 3 x 4 = - 1 x 2 - x 3 + 2x 4 = 4 0 = 0 What does the equation 0 = 0 mean? We can choose any values for x 1 , x 2 , x 3 , x 4 and this equation will be true, so we only need to consider further the first two equations, since the third is true no matter what. We can analyze the second equation without consideration of the variable x 1. It would appear that there is considerable latitude in how we can choose x 2 , x 3 , x 4 and make this equation true. Let us choose x 3 and x 4 to be anything we please, say x 3 = a and x 4 = b. Now we can take these arbitrary values for x 3 and x 4 , substitute them in equation 1, to obtain \n x 1 + 2a - 3 b = - 1 x 1 = - 1 - 2 a + 3b \nSimilarly, equation 2 becomes \nx 2 - a + 2b = 4 x 2 = 4 + a - 2 b So our arbitrary choices of values for x 3 and x 4 (a and b) translate into specific values of x 1 and x 2. The lone solution given in Example NSE was obtained by choosing a = 2 and b = 1. Now we can easily and quickly find many more (infinitely more). Suppose we choose a = 5 and b = -2, then we compute \n x 1 = - 1 - 2(5) + 3(-2) = - 17 x 2 = 4 + 5 - 2(-2) = 13 \nand you can verify that (x 1 , x 2 , x 3 , x 4 ) = (- 17 , 13 , 5 , -2) makes all three equations true. The entire solution set is written as \nS = { (- 1 - 2 a + 3b, 4 + a - 2 b, a, b)| a  C, b  C} It would be instructive to finish off your study of this example by taking the general form of the solutions given in this set and substituting them into each of the \nSSS S L E B e e z e r : A F i r s t C o u r s e i n L i n e a r A l g e b r a 15 \nthree equations and verify that they are true in each case (Exercise SSLE.M40). 4 \nIn the next section we will describe how to use equation operations to systematically solve any system of linear equations.

Although you will be \"rewriting\" in this exercise, you are not abandoning your earlier draft: this exercise is generative, meaning it is designed to help you produce new details, ideas, or surprising bits of language that you might integrate into your project. First, choose a part of your draft that (1) you really like but think could be better or (2) just isn't working for you. This excerpt should be no fewer than one hundred words and can include your entire essay, if you want. 127 COLLECTED WORKS \nThen complete your choice of one prompt from the list below: apply the instruction to the excerpt to create new content. _Read over your original once, but do not refer back to it after you start writing. Your goal here is to deviate from the first version, not reproduce it._ The idea here is to produce something new about your topic through constraint; you are reimagining your excerpt on a global scale. After completing one prompt, go back to the original and try at least one more or apply a different prompt to your new work. \n**1.** _Change genres._ For example, if your excerpt is written in typical essay form, try     writing it as poetry, or dialogue from a play/movie, or a radio advertisement. \n**2.** _Zoom in._ Focus on one image, color, idea, or word from your excerpt and     zoom way in. Meditate on this one thing with as much detail as possible. \n**3.** _Zoom out._ Step back from the excerpt and contextualize it with background     information, concurrent events, or information about relationships or     feelings. \n**4.** _Change point of view._ Try a new vantage point for your story by changing     pronouns and perspective. For instance, if your excerpt is in first person (I/     me), switch to second (you) or third person (he/she/they). \n**5.** _Change setting._ Resituate your excerpt in a different place or time. \n**6.** _Change your audience._ Rewrite the excerpt anticipating the expectations of a     different reader than you first intended. For example, if the original excerpt is     in the same speaking voice you would use with your friends, write as if your     strictest teacher or the president or your grandmother is reading it. If you've     written in an \"academic\" voice, try writing for your closest friend--use slang,     swear words, casual language, whatever. \n**7.** _Add another voice._ Instead of just the speaker of the essay narrating, add a     listener. This listener can agree, disagree, question, heckle, sympathize,     apologize, or respond in any other way you can imagine. \n**8.** _Change timeline (narrative sequence)._ Instead of moving chronologically     forward, rearrange the events to bounce around. \n**9.** _Change tense._ Narrate from a different vantage point by changing the     grammar. For example, instead of writing in past tense, write in present or     future tense. \n**10.** _Change tone._ Reimagine your writing in a different emotional register. For     instance, if your writing is predominantly nostalgic, try a bitter tone. If you     seem regretful, try to write as if you were proud.        A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 128 \n##### Reverse Outlining \n Have you ever written an outline before writing a draft? It can be a useful prewriting strategy, but it doesn't work for all writers. If you're like me, you prefer to brain-dump a bunch of ideas on the paper, then come back to organize and refocus during the revision process. One strategy that can help you here is reverse outlining. Divide a blank piece of paper into three columns, as demonstrated below. Number each paragraph of your draft, and write an equal numbered list down the left column of your blank piece of paper. Write \"Idea\" at the top of the middle column and \"Purpose\" at the top of the right column. Table 16.3 A worksheet example for reverse formatting \n##### Paragraph Number (P#) \n##### Idea \n##### (What is the P saying?) \n##### Purpose \n##### (What is the P doing?) \n##### Paragraph 1 Notes:^ Notes: \n##### Paragraph 2 Notes:^ Notes: \n##### Paragraph 3 Notes:^ Notes: \n##### Paragraph 4 Notes:^ Notes: \n##### Paragraph 5 Notes:^ Notes: \n##### Paragraph 6 Notes:^ Notes: \n##### Paragraph 7 Notes:^ Notes: \n Now wade back through your essay, identifying what each paragraph is saying and what each paragraph is doing. Choose a few key words or phrases for each column to record on your sheet of paper.  Try to use consistent language throughout the reverse outline so you can see where your paragraphs are saying or doing similar things.  A paragraph might have too many different ideas or too many different functions for you to concisely identify. This could be a sign that you need to divide that paragraph up. Here's a student's model reverse outline: 129 COLLECTED WORKS \n Table 16.4 A model of a reverse outline \n##### Paragraph \n##### Number (P) \n##### Idea \n##### (What is the P saying?) \n##### Purpose \n##### (What is the P doing?) \n##### Paragraph 1 \n Theater is an important part of education and childhood development.

Call to action, backing up and restating thesis But wait--there's more! Once you have identified the idea(s) and purpose(s) of each paragraph, you can start revising according to your observations. From the completed reverse outline, create a new outline with a different sequence, organization, focus, or balance. You can reorganize by  combining or dividing paragraphs,  rearranging ideas, and  adding or subtracting content. Reverse outlining can also be helpful in identifying gaps and redundancies: Now that you have a new outline, do any of your ideas seem too brief? Do you need more evidence for a certain argument? Do you see ideas repeated more than necessary?

Fluff refers to language that doesn't do work for you--language that simply takes up space or sits flat on the page rather than working economically and impactfully. Whether or not you've used it deliberately, all authors have been guilty of fluffy writing at one time or another. Example of fluff on social media [\"Presidents don't have to be smart\" from funnyjunk.com]. Fluff happens for a lot of reasons.  Of course, reaching a word or page count is the most common motivation.  Introductions and conclusions are often fluffy because the author can't find a way into or out of the subject or because the author doesn't know what their exact subject will be.  Sometimes, the presence of fluff is an indication that the author doesn't know enough about the subject or that their scope is too broad.  Other times, fluffy language is deployed in an effort to sound \"smarter\" or \"fancier\" or \"more academic\"--which is an understandable pitfall for developing writers. These circumstances, plus others, encourage us to use language that's not as effective, authentic, or economical. Fluff happens in a lot of ways; here are a few I've noticed: 131 COLLECTED WORKS \n Table 16.6 A list of common fluff origin stories \n##### Fluff's \n##### Supervillainous \n##### Alter-Ego \n##### Supervillain Origin Story \n##### Thesaurus \n##### syndrome \n A writer uses inappropriately complex language (often because of the right-click \"Synonyms\" function) to achieve a different tone. The more complex language might be used inaccurately or sound inauthentic because the author isn't as familiar with it. \n##### Roundabout \n##### phrasing \n Rather than making a direct statement (\"That man is a fool.\"), the author uses couching language or beats around the bush (\"If one takes into account each event, each decision, it would not be unwise for one to suggest that that man's behaviors are what some would call foolish.\") \n##### Abstraction or \n##### generalities \n If the author hasn't quite figured out what they want to say or has too broad of a scope, they might discuss an issue very generally without committing to specific, engaging details. \n##### Digression \n An author might get off topic, accidentally or deliberately, creating extraneous, irrelevant, or unconnected language. \n##### Ornamentation \n##### or flowery \n##### language \n Similarly to thesaurus syndrome, often referred to as \"purple prose,\" an author might choose words that sound pretty or smart but aren't necessarily the right words for their ideas. \n##### Wordy \n##### sentences \n Even if the sentences an author creates are grammatically correct, they might be wordier than necessary. Of course, there's a very fine line between detail and fluff. Avoiding fluff doesn't mean always using the fewest words possible. Instead, you should occasionally ask yourself in the revision process, How is this part contributing to the whole? Is this somehow building toward a bigger purpose? If the answer is no, then you need to revise. The goal should not necessarily be \"Don't write fluff\" but rather \"Learn to get rid of fluff in revision.\" In light of our focus on process, you are allowed to write fluff in the drafting period, so long as you learn to \"prune\" during revisions. (I use the word prune as an analogy for caring for a plant: just as you must cut the dead leaves off for the plant's health and growth, you will need to cut fluff so your writing can thrive.) Here are a few strategies:  Read out loud.  Ask yourself what a sentence is doing, rhetorically.  Combine like sentences, phrases, or ideas.  Use signposts, like topic-transition sentences (for yourself during revision and for your reader in the final draft).  Be specific--stay cognizant of your scope (globally) and the detail of your writing (locally). To practice revising for fluff, workshop the following excerpt by yourself or with a partner. Your goal is not to cut back to the smallest number of words but rather to prune out what you consider to be fluff and leave what you consider to be detail. You should be able to explain the choices you make.

There was a time long before today when an event occurred involving a young woman who was known to the world as Goldilocks. On the particular day at hand, Goldilocks made a spontaneous decision to wander through the forest, the trees growing up high above her flowing blonde pigtails. Some time after she commenced her voyage, but not after too long, she saw sitting on the horizon a small residency. Goldilocks rapped her knuckles on the door, but alas, no one answered the door. Therefore, Goldilocks decided that it would be a good idea to enter the unattended house, so she entered it. Atop the average-sized table in the kitchen of the house, there were three bowls of porridge, which is similar to oatmeal. Porridge is a very common dish in Europe; in fact, the Queen of England is well known for enjoying at least one daily bowl of porridge per day. Goldilocks, not unlike the Queen of England, enjoys eating porridge for its nutritional value. On this day, she was feeling quite hungry and wanted to eat. She decided that she should taste one of the three bowls of porridge, from which steam was rising indicating its temperature.

(255) A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 8 \n Don't be scared whenever you are given an assignment. Professors know what it was like to be in college and write all kinds of papers. They aren't trying to make your lives difficult, but it is their job to make us think and ponder about many things. Take your time and enjoy the paper. Make sure you answer the question being asked rather than rant on about something that is irrelevant to the prompt. TIMOTHEE PIZARRO writing student discussion question, blog post, essay exam, project proposal, or what have you--is ultimately about your learning. To succeed with writing assignments (and benefit from them), you first have to understand their learning-related purposes. As you write for the hypothetical audience of peer junior scholars, you're demonstrating to your professor how far you've gotten in analyzing your topic. Instructors don't assign writing lightly. Grading student writing is generally the hardest, most intensive work instructors do. You would do well to approach every assignment by putting yourself in the shoes of your instructor and asking yourself, \"Why did they give me this assignment? How does it fit into the learning goals of the course? Why is this question/topic/problem so important to my instructor that they are willing to spend evenings and weekends reading and commenting on several dozen papers on it?\" Most instructors do a lot to make their pedagogical goals and expectations transparent to students: they explain the course learning goals associated with assignments, provide grading rubrics in advance, and describe several strategies for succeeding. Other instructors...not so much. Some students perceive more open-ended assignments as evidence of a lazy, uncaring, or even incompetent instructor. Not so fast! Instructors certainly vary in the quantity and specificity of the guidelines and suggestions they distribute with each writing assignment. It is understandably frustrating when you feel you don't know how to direct your efforts to succeed with an assignment. However, except for rare egregious situations, you would do well to assume the best of your instructor and to appreciate the diversity of learning opportunities you have access to in college. Like one first-year student told Keith Hjortshoj, \"I think that every course, every assignment, is a different little puzzle I have to solve. What do I need to do here? When do I need to do it, and how long will it take? What does this teacher expect of me?\" (4). The transparency that you get from some professors--along with guides like this one--will be a big help to you in situations where you have to be scrappier and more proactive, piecing together the clues you get from your professors, the readings, and other course documents. \n##### The Prompt: What Does \"Analyze\" Mean Anyway? \n Often, the handout or other written text explaining the assignment--what instructors call the assignment prompt--will explain the purpose of the assignment, the required parameters (length, number and type of sources, referencing style, etc.), and the criteria for evaluation. Sometimes, though--especially when you are new to a field--you will encounter the baffling situation in which you comprehend every single sentence in the prompt but still have absolutely no idea how to approach the assignment. No one is doing anything wrong in a situation like that. It just means that further discussion of the assignment is in order. Here are some tips: 9 COLLECTED WORKS \n Look for verbs like \"compare,\" \"explain,\" \"justify,\" \"reflect,\" or the all-purpose \"analyze.\" You're not just producing a paper as an artifact; you're conveying, in written communication, some intellectual work you have done. So the question is, What kind of thinking are you supposed to do to deepen your learning? Many professors think in terms of assignment sequences. For example, a social science professor may ask you to write about a controversial issue three times: first, arguing for one side of the debate; second, arguing for another; and finally, arguing from a more comprehensive and nuanced perspective, incorporating text produced in the first two assignments. A sequence like that is designed to help you think through a complex issue. Another common one is a scaffolded research paper sequence: you first propose a topic, then prepare an annotated bibliography, then make the first draft, then make the final draft, and finally, perhaps, create a reflective paper. The preparatory assignments help ensure that you're on the right track, beginning the research process long before the final due date and taking the time to consider recasting your thesis, finding additional sources, or reorganizing your discussion. (Most instructors are perpetually frustrated with the \"one-and-done\" attitude that most students bring to their work, and some sequences are specifically designed to force you to really rethink your conclusions.) If the assignment isn't part of a sequence, think about where it falls in the semester and how it relates to readings and other assignments. Are there headings on the syllabus that indicate larger units of material? For example, if you see that a paper comes at the end of a three-week unit on the role of the internet in organizational behavior, then your professor likely wants you to synthesize that material in your own way. You should also check your notes and online course resources for any other guidelines about the workflow. Maybe you got a rubric a couple of weeks ago and forgot about it. Maybe your instructor posted a link about \"how to make an annotated bibliography\" but then forgot to mention it in class. When I hand out an assignment, I often ask students to do a five-minute or tenminute freewrite. A freewrite is when you just write, without stopping, for a set period of time. That doesn't sound very \"free\"; it actually sounds kind of coerced. The \"free\" part is what you write--it can be whatever comes to mind. Professional writers use freewriting to get started on a challenging (or distasteful) writing task or to overcome writer's block or a powerful urge to procrastinate. The idea is that if you just make yourself write, you can't help but produce some kind of useful nugget. Thus, even if the first eight sentences of your freewrite are all variations on \"I don't understand this\" or \"I'd really rather be doing something else,\" eventually you'll write something like \"I guess the main point of this is...\" and--booyah!--you're off and running. As an instructor, I've found that asking students to do a brief freewrite right after I hand out an assignment generates useful clarification questions. If your \n##### Focus on the verbs \n##### Put the assignment in context \n##### Try a freewrite \n A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 10 \n instructor doesn't make time for that in class, a quick freewrite on your own will quickly reveal whether you need clarification about the assignment and, often, what questions to ask. Even the most skillfully crafted assignments may need some verbal clarification, especially because students' familiarity with the field can vary enormously. Asking for clarification is a good thing. Be aware, though, that instructors get frustrated when they perceive that students want to skip doing their own thinking and instead receive an exact recipe for an A paper. Go ahead and ask for clarification, but try to convey that you want to learn and you're ready to work. In general, avoid starting a question with \"Do we have to...\" because I can guarantee that your instructor is thinking, \"You don't have to do anything. You're an adult. You chose college. You chose this class. You're free to exercise your right to fail.\" Similarly, avoid asking the professor about what he or she \"wants.\" You're not performing some service for the instructor when you write a paper. What they \"want\" is for you to really think about the material. Table 2.1 Suggested alternatives to frequently asked (and potentially annoying) questions \n##### Potentially annoying \n##### questions \n##### Preferable alternatives \n##### \"I don't get it. Can you \n##### explain this more?\" or \n##### \"What do you want us \n##### to do?\" \n \"I see that we are comparing and contrasting these two cases. What should be our focus? Their causes? Their impacts? Their implications? All of those things?\" or \"I'm unfamiliar with how art historians analyze a painting. Could you say more about what questions I should have in mind to do this kind of analysis?\" \n##### \"How many sources do \n##### we have to cite?\" \n \"Is there a typical range for the number of sources a well-written paper would cite for this assignment?\" or \"Could you say more about what the sources are for? Is it more that we're analyzing these texts in this paper, or are we using these texts to analyze some other case?\" \n##### \"What do I have to do \n##### to get an A on this \n##### paper?\" \n \"Could I meet with you to get feedback on my (preprepared) plans/outline/thesis/draft?\" or \"I'm not sure how to approach this assignment. Are there any good examples or resources you could point me to?\" If an instructor provides a grading rubric with an assignment prompt, you can be sure that he or she will use it to grade your paper. He or she may not go over it in class, but it's the clearest possible statement of what the professor is looking for in the paper. If it's wordy, it may seem like those online \"terms and conditions\" that we routinely accept without reading. But you really should read it over carefully before you begin and again as your work progresses. A lot of rubrics do have some useful specifics. Mine, for example, often contain phrases like \"makes at least six error-free connections to concepts or ideas from the course\" or \"gives thorough consideration to at least one plausible counterargument.\" Even less specific criteria (such as \"incorporates course concepts\" and \"considers counterarguments\") will tell you how you should be spending your writing time. \n##### Ask for clarification the right way. \n#### RUBRICS AS ROAD MAPS \n 11 COLLECTED WORKS \n Even the best rubrics aren't completely transparent. They simply can't be. Take, for example, the Association of American Colleges and Universities (AAC&U) rubric. It has been drafted and repeatedly revised by a multidisciplinary expert panel and tested multiple times on sample student work to ensure reliability. But it still seems kind of vague. What is the real difference between \"demonstrating a thorough understanding of context, audience, and purpose\" and \"demonstrating adequate consideration\" of the same? It depends on the specific context. So how can you know whether you've done that? A big part of what you're learning, through feedback from your professors, is to judge the quality of your writing for yourself. Your future bosses are counting on that. At this point, it is better to think of rubrics as road maps displaying your destination rather than GPS systems directing every move you make. Behind any rubric is the essential goal of higher education: helping you take charge of your own learning, which means writing like an independently motivated scholar. Are you tasked with proposing a research paper topic? Don't just tell the professor what you want to do; convince him or her of the salience of your topic as if you were a scholar seeking grant money. Is it a reflection paper? Then outline both the insights you've gained and the intriguing questions that remain, as a scholar would. Are you writing a thesis-driven analytical paper? Then apply the concepts you've learned to a new problem or situation. Write as if your scholarly peers around the country are eagerly awaiting your unique insights. Descriptors like \"thoroughness\" or \"mastery\" or \"detailed attention\" convey the vision of student writers making the time and rigorous mental effort to offer something new to the ongoing, multistranded academic conversation. What your professor wants, in short, is critical thinking. Critical thinking is one of those terms that has been used so often and in so many different ways that it often seems meaningless. It also makes one wonder, is there such a thing as uncritical thinking? If you aren't thinking critically, then are you even thinking? Despite the prevalent ambiguities, critical thinking actually does mean something. The Association of American Colleges and Universities (AAC&U) usefully defines it as \"a habit of mind characterized by the comprehensive exploration of issues, ideas, artifacts, and events before accepting or formulating an opinion or conclusion\" (\"Value Rubrics\"). That definition aligns with the best description of critical thinking I ever heard; it came from my junior high art teacher, Joe Bolger. He once asked us, \"What color is the ceiling?\" In that withering tween tone, we reluctantly replied, \"White.\" He then asked, \"What color is it really?\" We deigned to aim our preadolescent eyes upward and eventually began to offer more accurate answers: \"Ivory?\" \"Yellowish tan.\" \"It's gray in that corner.\" After finally getting a few thoughtful responses, Mr. Bolger said something like, \"Making good art is about drawing what you see, not what you think you're supposed to see.\" The AAC&U definition above essentially amounts to the same thing: taking a good look and deciding what you really think rather than relying on the first idea or assumption that comes to mind. The critical thinking rubric produced by the AAC&U describes the relevant activities of critical thinking in more detail. To think critically, you need to establish the question or problem, evaluate your sources, interrogate the assumptions informing the ideas you encounter, and develop a nuanced position that accounts for multiple perspectives (\"Value Rubrics\"). \n#### WHAT'S CRITICAL ABOUT CRITICAL THINKING? \n A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 12 \nWhile you are probably used to providing some evidence for your claims, you can see that college-level expectations go quite a bit further. When professors assign an analytical paper, they don't just want you to formulate a plausible-sounding argument. They want you to dig into the evidence, think hard about unspoken assumptions and the influence of context, and then explain what you really think and why. Interestingly, the AAC&U defines critical thinking as a \"habit of mind\" rather than a discrete achievement. And there are at least two reasons to see critical thinking as a craft or art to pursue rather than a task to check off.

In fact, anything that has this sort of part-whole containment hierarchy is just asking to be represented as a tree. \nIn computer programming, the applications are too numerous to name. Compilers scan code and build a \"parse tree\" of its underlying meaning. HTML is a way of structuring plain text into a tree-like hierarchy of displayable elements. AI chess programs build trees representing their possible future moves and their opponent's probable responses, in order to \"see many moves ahead\" and evaluate their best options. Object-oriented designs involve \"inheritance hierarchies\" of classes, each one specialized from a specific other. _Etc._ Other than a simple sequence (like an array), trees are probably the most common data structure in all of computer science. \n**Rooted tree terminology** \nRooted trees carry with them a number of terms. I'll use the tree on the left side of Figure 5.16 as an illustration of each: \n**root.** The node at the top of the tree, which is A in our example. Note that unlike trees in the real world, computer science trees have their root at the top and grow down. Every tree has a root except the **empty tree** , which is the \"tree\" that has no nodes at all in it. (It's kind of weird thinking of \"nothing\" as a tree, but it's kind of like the empty set , which is still a set.) \n**parent.** Every node except the root has one parent: the node immediately above it. D's parent is C, C's parent is B, F's \n5.2. TREES 115 \n parent is A, and A has no parent. \n**child.** Some nodes have children, which are nodes connected directly below it. A's children are F and B, C's are D and E, B's only child is C, and E has no children. \n**sibling.** A node with the same parent. E's sibling is D, B's is F, and none of the other nodes have siblings. \n**ancestor.** Your parent, grandparent, great-grandparent, _etc._ , all the way back to the root. B's only ancestor is A, while E's ancestors are C, B, and A. Note that F is _not_ C's ancestor, even though it's above it on the diagram: there's no connection from C to F, except back through the root (which doesn't count). \n**descendant.** Your children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren, _etc._ , all the way to the leaves. B's descendants are C, D and E, while A's are F, B, C, D, and E. \n**leaf.** A node with no children. F, D, and E are leaves. Note that in a (very) small tree, the root could itself be a leaf. \n**internal node.** Any node that's not a leaf. A, B, and C are the internal nodes in our example. \n**depth (of a node).** A node's depth is the distance (in number of nodes) from it to the root. The root itself has depth zero. In our example, B is of depth 1, E is of depth 3, and A is of depth 0. \n**height (of a tree).** A rooted tree's height is the maximum depth of any of its nodes; _i.e._ , the maximum distance from the root to any node. Our example has a height of 3, since the \"deepest\" nodes are D and E, each with a depth of 3. A tree with just one node is considered to have a height of 0. Bizarrely, but to be consistent, we'll say that the empty tree has height -1! Strange, but what else could it be? To say it has height 0 seems inconsistent with a one-node tree also having height \n0. At any rate, this won't come up much. \n116 CHAPTER 5. STRUCTURES \n**level.** All the nodes with the same depth are considered on the same \"level.\" B and F are on level 1, and D and E are on level \n3. Nodes on the same level are _not_ necessarily siblings. If F had a child named G in the example diagram, then G and C would be on the same level (2), but would _not_ be siblings because they have different parents. (We might call them \"cousins\" to continue the family analogy.) \n**subtree.** Finally, much of what gives trees their expressive power is their **recursive** nature. This means that a tree is made up of _other (smaller) trees._ Consider our example. It is a tree with a root of A. But the two children of A are each trees in their own right! F itself is a tree with only one node. B and its descendants make another tree with four nodes. We consider these two trees to be subtrees of the original tree. The notion of \"root\" shifts somewhat as we consider subtrees -- A is the root of the original tree, but B is the root of the second subtree. When we consider B's children, we see that there is yet another subtree, which is rooted at C. And so on. It's easy to see that any subtree fulfills all the properties of trees, and so everything we've said above applies also to it. \n**Binary trees (BT's)** \nThe nodes in a rooted tree can have any number of children. There's a special type of rooted tree, though, called a **binary tree** which we restrict by simply saying that _each node can have at most two children._ Furthermore, we'll label each of these two children as the \"left child\" and \"right child.\" (Note that a particular node might well have _only_ a left child, or _only_ a right child, but it's still important to know which direction that child is.) \nThe left half of Figure 5.16 is a binary tree, but the right half is not (C has three children). A larger binary tree (of height 4) is shown in Figure 5.17. \n5.2. TREES 117 \n G \n K \n D \n O \n I \n M \n C E \n H \n A B \n F N \n L \n Figure 5.17: A binary tree. \n**Traversing binary trees** \nThere were two ways of traversing a graph: breadth-first, and depth-first. Curiously, there are three ways of traversing a tree: **pre-order** , **post-order** , and **in-order**. All three begin at the root, and all three consider each of the root's children as subtrees. The difference is in the order of visitation. \n To traverse a tree pre-order , we: \n1. Visit the root. \n2. Treat the left child and all its descendants as a subtree,     and traverse it in its entirety. \n3. Do the same with the right child. \nIt's tricky because you have to remember that each time you \"treat a child as a subtree\" you do _the whole traversal process_ on that subtree. This involves remembering where you were once you finish. \nFollow this example carefully. For the tree in Figure 5.17, we begin by visiting G. Then, we traverse the whole \"K subtree.\" This involves visiting K itself, and then traversing _its_ whole left subtree (anchored at D). After we visit the D node, we discover that it actually _has_ no left subtree, so we go ahead and traverse its right \n118 CHAPTER 5. STRUCTURES \nsubtree. This visits O followed by I (since O has no left subtree either) which finally returns back up the ladder. \nIt's at this point where it's easy to get lost. We finish visiting I, and then we have to ask \"okay, where the heck were we? How did we get here?\" The answer is that we had just been at the K node, where we had traversed its left (D) subtree. So now what is it time to do? Traverse the _right_ subtree, of course, which is M. This involves visiting M, C, and E (in that order) before returning to the very top, G. \nNow we're in the same sort of situation where we could have gotten lost before: we've spent a lot of time in the tangled mess of G's left subtree, and we just have to remember that it's now time to do G's right subtree. Follow this same procedure, and the entire order of visitation ends up being: G, K, D, O, I, M, C, E, H, A, B, F, N, L. (See Figure 5.18 for a visual.) \n G \n 1 \n K \n 2 \n D \n 3 \n O \n 4 \n I \n 5 \n M \n 6 \n C \n 7 E \n 8 \n H \n 9 \n A \n 10 B \n 11 \n F \n 12 N \n 13 \n L \n 14 \n Figure 5.18: The order of node visitation in pre-order traversal. \n To traverse a tree post-order , we: \n1. Treat the left child and all its descendants as a subtree,     and traverse it in its entirety. \n2. Do the same with the right child. \n3. Visit the root. \n5.2. TREES 119 \nIt's the same as pre-order, except that we visit the root after the children instead of before. Still, despite its similarity, this has always been the trickiest one for me. Everything seems postponed, and you have to remember what order to do it in later. \nFor our sample tree, the first node visited turns out to be I. This is because we have to postpone visiting G until we finish its left (and right) subtree; then we postpone K until we finish its left (and right) subtree; postpone D until we're done with O's subtree, and postpone O until we do I. Then finally, the thing begins to unwind...all the way back up to K. But we can't actually visit K itself yet, because we have to do its right subtree. This results in C, E, and M, in that order. _Then_ we can do K, but we still can't do G because we have its whole right subtree's world to contend with. The entire order ends up being: I, O, D, C, E, M, K, A, F, L, N, B, H, and finally G. (See Figure 5.19 for a visual.) \nNote that this is not remotely the reverse of the pre-order visitation, as you might expect. G is last instead of first, but the rest is all jumbled up. \n G \n 14 \n K \n 7 \n D \n 3 \n O \n 2 \n I \n 1 \n M \n 6 \n C \n 4 E \n 5 \n H \n 13 \n A \n 8 B \n 12 \n F \n 9 N \n 11 \n L \n 10 \nFigure 5.19: The order of node visitation in **post-order** traversal. \n120 CHAPTER 5. STRUCTURES \n Finally, to traverse a tree in-order , we: \n1. Treat the left child and all its descendants as a subtree,     and traverse it in its entirety. \n2. Visit the root. \n3. Traverse the right subtree in its entirety. \nSo instead of visiting the root first (pre-order) or last (post-order) we treat it in between our left and right children. This might seem to be a strange thing to do, but there's a method to the madness which will become clear in the next section. \nFor the sample tree, the first visited node is D. This is because it's the first node encountered that doesn't have a left subtree, which means step 1 doesn't need to do anything. This is followed by O and I, for the same reason. We then visit K before its right subtree, which in turn visits C, M, and E, in that order. The final order is: D, O, I, K, C, M, E, G, A, H, F, B, L, N. (See Figure 5.20.) \nIf your nodes are spaced out evenly, you can read the in-order traversal off the diagram by moving your eyes left to right. Be careful about this, though, because ultimately the spatial position doesn't matter, but rather the relationships between nodes. For instance, if I had drawn node I further to the right, in order to make the lines between D-O-I less steep, that I node might have been pushed physically to the right of K. But that wouldn't change the order and have K visited earlier. \nFinally, it's worth mentioning that all of these traversal methods make elegant use of **recursion**. Recursion is a way of taking a large problem and breaking it up into similar, but smaller, subproblems. Then, each of those subproblems can be attacked in the same way as you attacked the larger problem: by breaking _them_ up into subproblems. All you need is a rule for eventually stopping the \"breaking up\" process by actually doing something. \nEvery time one of these traversal processes treats a left or right child as a subtree, they are \"recursing\" by re-initiating the whole traversal process on a smaller tree. Pre-order traversal, for instance, \n5.2.

There are four steps in the proof, and the first three are about showing that B and C have the same number of pivot columns, in the same places. In other words, the \"primed\" symbols are a necessary fiction. First Step. Suppose that d 1 < d' 1. Then 1 = [B] 1 d 1 Definition RREF \n = \n ^ m \n k=1 \n d 1 k [C]kd 1 \nSSR R E F B e e z e r : A F i r s t C o u r s e i n L i n e a r A l g e b r a 27 \n = \n ^ m \n k=1 \n d 1 k(0) d 1 < d' 1 \n = 0 \nThe entries of C are all zero since they are left and below of the leading 1 in row 1 and column d' 1 of C. This is a contradiction, so we know that d 1 >= d' 1. By an entirely similar argument, reversing the roles of B and C, we could conclude that d 1 <= d' 1. Together this means that d 1 = d' 1. Second Step. Suppose that we have determined that d 1 = d' 1 , d 2 = d' 2 , d 3 = d' 3 , \n... dp = d' p. Let us now show that dp+1 = d' p+1. Working towards a contradiction, suppose that dp+1 < d' p+1. For 1 <= ` <= p, \n 0 = [B]p+1,d Definition RREF \n = \n ^ m \n k=1 \n dp+1,k [C]kd \n = \n ^ m \n k=1 \n dp+1,k [C]kd'  \n = dp+1, [C]d'  + \n ^ m \n k=1 k 6 = \n dp+1,k [C]kd'  Property CACN \n = dp+1,(1) + \n ^ m \n k k=1 6 = \n dp+1,k(0) Definition RREF \n = dp+1, \nNow, \n 1 = [B]p+1,dp+1 Definition RREF \n = \n ^ m \n k=1 \n dp+1,k [C]kdp+1 \n = \n ^ p \n k=1 \n dp+1,k [C]kdp+1 + \n ^ m \n k=p+1 \n dp+1,k [C]kdp+1 Property AACN \n = \n ^ p \n k=1 \n (0) [C]kdp+1 + \n ^ m \n k=p+1 \n dp+1,k [C]kdp+1 \n = \n ^ m \n k=p+1 \n dp+1,k [C]kdp+1 \n = \n ^ m \n k=p+1 \n dp+1,k(0) dp+1 < d' p+1 \n = 0 \nThis contradiction shows that dp+1 >= d' p+1. By an entirely similar argument, we could conclude that dp+1 <= d' p+1, and therefore dp+1 = d' p+1. Third Step. Now we establish that r = r'. Suppose that r'^ < r. By the arguments above, we know that d 1 = d' 1 , d 2 = d' 2 , d 3 = d' 3 ,... , dr'^ = d' r'. For 1 <= ` <= r'^ < r, \n 0 = [B]rd Definition RREF \n = \n ^ m \n k=1 \n drk [C]kd \nSSR R E F B e e z e r : A F i r s t C o u r s e i n L i n e a r A l g e b r a 28 \n = \n ^ r' \n k=1 \n drk [C]kd + \n ^ m \n k=r'^ +1 \n drk [C]kd Property AACN \n = \n ^ r' \n k=1 \n drk [C]kd + \n ^ m \n k=r'^ +1 \n drk(0) Property AACN \n = \n ^ r' \n k=1 \n drk [C]kd \n = \n ^ r' \n k=1 \n drk [C]kd'  \n = dr [C]d'  + \n ^ r' \n k=1 k 6 = \n drk [C]kd'  Property CACN \n = dr(1) + \n ^ r' \n k=1 k 6 = \n drk(0) Definition RREF \n = dr \nNow examine the entries of row r of B, \n [B]rj = \n ^ m \n k=1 \n drk [C]kj \n = \n ^ r' \n k=1 \n drk [C]kj + \n ^ m \n k=r'^ +1 \n drk [C]kj Property CACN \n = \n ^ r' \n k=1 \n drk [C]kj + \n ^ m \n k=r'^ +1 \n drk(0) Definition RREF \n = \n ^ r' \n k=1 \n drk [C]kj \n = \n ^ r' \n k=1 \n (0) [C]kj \n = 0 \nSo row r is a totally zero row, contradicting that this should be the bottommost nonzero row of B. So r'^ >= r. By an entirely similar argument, reversing the roles of B and C, we would conclude that r'^ <= r and therefore r = r'. Thus, combining the first three steps we can say that D = D'. In other words, B and C have the same pivot columns, in the same locations. Fourth Step. In this final step, we will not argue by contradiction. Our intent is to determine the values of the dij. Notice that we can use the values of the di interchangeably for B and C. Here we go, \n 1 = [B]idi Definition RREF \n = \n ^ m \n k=1 \n dik [C]kdi \n = dii [C]idi + \n ^ m \n k=1 k 6 =i \n dik [C]kdi Property CACN \nSSR R E F B e e z e r : A F i r s t C o u r s e i n L i n e a r A l g e b r a 29 \n = dii(1) + \n ^ m \n k=1 k 6 =i \n dik(0) Definition RREF \n = dii \nand for ` 6 = i \n 0 = [B]id Definition RREF \n = \n ^ m \n k=1 \n dik [C]kd \n = di [C]d + \n ^ m \n k=1 k 6 = \n dik [C]kd Property CACN \n = di(1) + \n ^ m \n k=1 k 6 = \n dik(0) Definition RREF \n = di \nFinally, having determined the values of the dij , we can show that B = C. For 1 <= i <= m, 1 <= j <= n, \n [B]ij = \n ^ m \n k=1 \n dik [C]kj \n = dii [C]ij + \n ^ m \n k=1 k 6 =i \n dik [C]kj Property CACN \n = (1) [C]ij + \n ^ m \n k k=1 6 =i \n (0) [C]kj \n = [C]ij \nSo B and C have equal values in every entry, and so are the same matrix. \u0004 \nWe will now run through some examples of using these definitions and theorems to solve some systems of equations. From now on, when we have a matrix in reduced row-echelon form, we will mark the leading 1's with a small box. This will help you count, and identify, the pivot columns. In your work, you can box 'em, circle 'em or write 'em in a different color -- just identify 'em somehow. This device will prove very useful later and is a very good habit to start developing right now. \nExample SAB Solutions for Archetype B Let us find the solutions to the following system of equations, \n - 7 x 1 - 6 x 2 - 12 x 3 = - 33 5 x 1 + 5x 2 + 7x 3 = 24 x 1 + 4x 3 = 5 First, form the augmented matrix, [- 7 - 6 - 12 - 33 5 5 7 24 1 0 4 5 \n ] \nand work to reduced row-echelon form, first with j = 1, \n R 1 -R 3 ------ \n [ 1 0 4 5 5 5 7 24 - 7 - 6 - 12 - 33 \n ] - 5 R 1 +R 2 ------- \n [ 1 0 4 5 0 5 - 13 - 1 - 7 - 6 - 12 - 33 \n ] \nSSR R E F B e e z e r : A F i r s t C o u r s e i n L i n e a r A l g e b r a 30 \n -^7 -R-^1 +--R-^3 \n   \n 1 0 4 5 0 5 - 13 - 1 0 - 6 16 2 \n   \nNow, with j = 2, \n(^15) R 2 ----   1 0 4 5 0 1 - 513 - 51 0 - 6 16 2   (^) -^6 -R-^2 -+-R-^3   1 0 4 5 0 1 - 513 - 51 (^0 0 2545)   And finally, with j = 3, (^52) R 3 ----   1 0 4 5 0 1 - 513 - 51 0 0 1 2   (^135) R 3 +R 2 -------   1 0 4 5 0 1 0 5 0 0 1 2   - 4 R 3 +R 1 -------   1 0 0 - 3 0 1 0 5 0 0 1 2   This is now the augmented matrix of a very simple system of equations, namely x 1 = -3, x 2 = 5, x 3 = 2, which has an obvious solution.

This works out to 256, but we can't actually store the number 256 in a byte if we're using the bit pattern 000000002 (or 0016 ) to represent zero. The highest value would be 111111112 (or FF 16 ), which is 25610. How do we store a number larger than that? Simply use more than one byte, of course. If we used two bytes of memory, and treated them as concatenated one after the other, that would give us 16 bits, allowing us to store up to the number 00000000000000002 = FFFF 16 = 65,535 10. We'd call one of these bytes -- the one representing the 20 's place up to the 27 's place -- the least significant _byte_ , and the other one -- containing places 28 through 215 -- the most significant byte. Extending to more than two bytes to accommodate even larger numbers is done in the obvious way. \n7.4. BINARY (BASE 2) 183 \n**Binary representation schemes** \nThat's mostly all there is to it. But there's one thing we haven't discussed yet, and that's _negative_ numbers. We know how to represent any positive number (or zero) with an ordinary place value scheme. But how do we store a number like - 5? \nThere are three different schemes for treating negative numbers, each with its strengths and weaknesses. \n**Unsigned** \nThe simplest scheme is called **unsigned** , and it simply means that we don't _allow_ negative numbers. For one byte, we have 256 different bit patterns at our disposal, and we might just choose to allocate them all to represent positive numbers, so as to get the widest range. This makes sense for, say, a C++ program variable called heightInInches which we know can never meaningfully be negative (no one has a negative height). \nThe advantage of this scheme is simply that we can represent the greatest possible range of positive numbers, which is sometimes the goal. Each of the alternative schemes carves off a chunk of these available bit patterns and devotes them to representing negative numbers, leaving fewer left over for positive numbers. There's no free lunch: you have to decide how you want to \"spend\" your available bit patterns depending on what values you need to represent. \n**Sign-magnitude** \nThe **sign-magnitude** scheme is probably the first thing you'd think of to solve the negative number representation problem. We need to store the sign of the number somehow, and a sign is inherently a two-valued thing (either positive or negative), so why not peel off one of the bits and use it to represent the sign? The remaining bits can then be used in the ordinary way to represent the magnitude of the number. \nThe way this is most often done is to take the left-most bit and use it as the **sign bit**. This bit now has _no other meaning_. It \n184 CHAPTER 7. NUMBERS \ncan't \"double\" as the 128's place, because then there'd be no way to distinguish between, say, 129 and - 129 (each would be represented with 10000001 .) No, the sign bit must be considered \"spent money,\" and its expressive power cannot be reclaimed to also represent part of the magnitude. By convention, if the sign bit is 0 this represents a _positive_ number, and a sign bit of 1 represents a _negative_ number. (That might seem counterintuitive, but hey, that's the way it is.) \nSo this number in sign-magnitude: \n 0 0100110 \nrepresents the decimal number 38. That's because the sign bit (bolded, on the far left) is 0, which means the number is positive. The magnitude of the number is contained in the other 7 bits, which gives 32 + 4 + 2 = 38. This number, on the other hand: \n 1 0100110 \nrepresents - 38. The magnitude is the same, but the sign bit is 1 so this pattern now \"means\" a negative number. \nClearly we have reduced our range of positive numbers in exchange for the ability to also store negatives. We have 7 bits of range instead of 8, so instead of 255, our highest possible value is merely \n127. On the other end, the lowest possible value is - 127. \nIf you have sharp eyes, you may have noticed a discrepancy in the counting. With the sign-magnitude approach, we can hold numbers in the range - 127 to 127. But wait: that's only 255 different values, not 256! Why did we lose one value of expressive power? The answer is that the sign-magnitude scheme has _two ways_ of representing _zero_. The bit pattern 00000000 is obviously zero, but so is 10000000 (which you might call \"negative zero.\") Using two different patterns to represent the same value is a little wasteful, but the situation is actually worse than that. Having to account for both patterns means that computer hardware using the signmagnitude scheme is inevitably more complicated. To compare two \n7.4. BINARY (BASE 2) 185 \nbytes to see if they're equal, you'd think we'd just compare each bit position, and if they were all the same, the bytes would be declared equal, otherwise no. Alas, this is no longer quite that simple. The two zero patterns must be considered numerically equal, so our digital logic now has to contain a special case. \"To be equal, all the bits have to be the same... oh, but actually not if the right-most seven are all zeroes in both bytes. In that case, it doesn't matter what the left-most bit contains.\" Maddening. \n**Two's-complement** \nThis shortcoming in the sign-magnitude scheme is remedied with the **two's-complement** scheme, which is the one actually used most often in practice. It'll seem weird at first -- certainly not as intuitive as the first two -- but it leads to a critically important feature that we'll look at shortly. \nFirst, the rules. To interpret a two's-complement number, you: \n1. Look at the left-most bit (just like in sign-magnitude). If     it's a 0, you have a positive number. If it's a 1, you have a     negative number. \n2. If it's a positive number, the other 7 bits give you the mag-     nitude (just like in sign-magnitude). \n3. If, however, it's a negative number, then to discover the mag-     nitude of that negative number you must _flip all the bits and_     _add one_. This will give you a positive number which is the     absolute value of your negative number. \nEasy example: take the byte 00100110. The left-most bit is a 0, which means it's a positive number, and as we discovered above, the remaining 7 bits give a magnitude of 38. So this is the number 38. \nHarder example: take the byte 10100110. The left-most bit is a 1, which means it's negative. Okay: negative _what_? How do we find the magnitude? Well, we \"flip\" all the bits ( _i.e._ , invert each one \n186 CHAPTER 7. NUMBERS \nfrom 0 to 1 or vice versa) to get: \n 01011001 \nand then add one to the result: \n 1 01011001 + 1 01011010 \nThis black magic produces the value 010110102 , which converts to 9010. **This means that the original number, 10100110 , corresponds to the value -90.** \n\"Flipping all the bits and adding one\" is the cookbook procedure for taking the complement (negative) of a number in the two'scomplement scheme. It works in reverse, too. Let's start with 90 this time and crank through the process again, making sure we get -90. \nStart with the binary representation of 9010 : \n 01011010 \nFlip all the bits to get: 10100101 \nand finally add one to the result: \n 1 10100101 + 1 10100110 \nWe get 10100110 , which was precisely the number we originally began with, and which we have already determined represents -90. \nNow you may ask what we gain from all this. Surely this scheme is considerably more convoluted than the simple idea of reserving one bit as a sign bit, and treating the rest as a magnitude. But it turns out there is indeed a method to the madness. Strange as \n7.4. BINARY (BASE 2) 187 \nit sounds, a two's-complement representation scheme allows us to _perform addition and subtraction with a single operation._ \nIn first grade (or so), you learned the procedure for adding multidigit numbers, which we've followed several times in this chapter. It involves adding the digits right-to-left and possibly \"carrying.\" Then in second grade (or so), you learned the procedure for _subtracting_ multi-digit numbers. It involves subtracting the digits right-to-left and possibly \"borrowing.\" If you're like me, you found adding easier than subtracting. It's easy to just carry the one, but to borrow requires looking at the digit to the left, making sure that you _can_ borrow from it ( _i.e._ , that it's not already 0), borrowing from further left until you actually find an available non-zero value, hoping the number on the bottom is actually less than the one on the top (because otherwise you have to switch the order and then add a negative sign to the result), and keeping all of that straight as you march down the line. \nEven if you didn't find subtracting more difficult than adding, though, you can't argue that it's still a completely _different_ algorithm, with different rules to follow. In computer hardware, we have to implement different circuitry to perform each operation, which is more difficult, costly, error-prone, and power-draining. \nThe wonderful thing about two's-complement, however, is that with this scheme we actually _never need to use the subtraction algorithm._ If we want to subtract two numbers -- say, 24 - 37 -- we can instead take the complement of the second number and then add them. Instead of 24 - 37 we compute 24 + (-37). \nLet's see it in action. Using conversion procedures, we can figure out that 2410 is: \n 00011000 \nand that _positive_ 3710 is: \n 00100101 \nIf we wanted to compute 24 + 37, we'd just add these. But instead we're looking for 24 - 37 , so we'll take the complement of 37 to find \n188 CHAPTER 7. NUMBERS \n- 37. Flip all the bits of 37: \n 11011010 \nand add one: 1 1011010 + 1 1 1011011 \nand so now we've determined that in the two's-complement scheme, - 37 is represented by 110110112. \nWe're now ready to compute 24 + (-37): \n 1 1 \n00011000 - this is (^2410) + 11011011 - this is - (^3710) 11110011 So we have our two's-complement answer, 11110011. What value does that correspond to? Well, the left-most bit is a 1, so it's a negative number. To find out what it's the negative _of_ , flip all the bits and add one: 0 0001100 - flip the bits to get + 1 - add one 0 0001101 This is positive 13, which means the number we inverted to get it -- 11110011 -- must represent - 13. And that is indeed the correct answer, for 24 - 37 = - 13. One last word on two's-complement: what is the _range_ of numbers we can represent? It turns out to be -128 to 127. The highest value is 01111111 , which is 127. You might think the lowest value would be represented as 11111111 , but if you work it out, you'll find that this is actually the number - 1. The lowest number is actually the bit pattern 10000000 , which is - 128. **Overflow** One last sticky detail we need to cover has to do with **overflow**. When we add two numbers, there is the possibility that the result \n7.4. BINARY (BASE 2) 189 \nwill contain one more digit than the original numbers did. You've probably seen this on a hand calculator when you press \"=\" and get an \"E\" (for \"error\") in the display. If there are only ten digits on your display, adding two ten-digit numbers will (sometimes) result in an eleven-digit number that your calculator can't display, and it's alerting you to that fact so you don't misinterpret the result. Here, we might add two 8-bit quantities and end up with a 9-bit quantity that can't fit in one byte. This situation is called overflow, and we need to detect when it occurs. \nThe rules for detecting overflow are different depending on the scheme. For _unsigned_ numbers, the rule is simple: if a 1 is carried out from the MSB (far left-side), then we have overflow. So if I were to try to add 15510 and 10810 : \n 1 1 1 1 \n10011011 - (^15510) + 01101100 - (^10810) 1 00001111 then I get a carry out left into the 9th digit.

It says: \n1. _If_ a predicate is true for a certain number, \n2. _and_ its being true for some number would reliably mean that     it's also true for the next number ( _i.e._ , one number greater), \n3. _then_ it's true for all numbers. \nAll you have to do is prove those two things, and you've effectively proven it for every case. \nThe first step is called the **base case** , and the \"certain number\" we pick is normally either 0 or 1. The second step, called the **inductive step** , is where all the trouble lies. You have to look really, really carefully at how it's worded, above. We are _not_ assuming \n234 CHAPTER 9. PROOF \nthat the predicate is true for any old number! We are simply considering, _if_ it's true for any old number, whether that would necessarily imply it's also true for the next number. In terms of the predicate, we're asking \"does P(k) imply P(k +1)?\" In other words: \"we aren't sure if P(k) is true. But if it is -- a big \"if,\" of course -- would that logically demand that P(k + 1) was also true?\" If you can prove that it does, then you're in business. \nThe whole thing is set up like a row of dominos. If one domino falls, then the one after it will also fall. And if that one falls, then so will the next. All that is needed is a base case to tip over the first domino, and by this trail of causality, _all_ the dominos will fall. \nOne terminology note: the entire second step is called the inductive step, but the first half of it (the part where we assume that P(k) is true) is called the **inductive hypothesis**. We never prove the inductive hypothesis; rather, we assume it, and then see if that allows us to deduce that P(k + 1) would also be true. \n**Example 1** \nLet's work this out for the drinking/voting example. Let Vote(n) be the proposition that a citizen of age n can vote. Our proof goes like this: \n1. **base case.** Vote(21) is true, because a 21-year old is old     enough to vote in the state and national elections. \n2. **inductive step.** Vote(k)=Vote(k+1). Why? Because     nobody's gettin' any younger. If you can vote in a particular     year, then you're also old enough to vote next year. Unless     the laws change, there will never be a case when someone old     enough to vote this year turns out to be too young to vote     next year. \n3. **conclusion.** Wow. n >= 21 Vote(n). We're done. _Q.E.D._     and all that. \nThe only specific example we showed was true was Vote(21). And yet we managed to prove Vote(n) for _any_ number n >= 21. \n9.3. PROOF BY INDUCTION 235 \nLet's look back at that inductive step, because that's where all the action is. It's crucial to understand what that step does _not_ say. It doesn't say \"Vote(k) is true for some number k.\" If it did, then since k's value is arbitrary at that point, we would basically be assuming the very thing we were supposed to prove, which is circular reasoning and extremely unconvincing. But that's not what we did. Instead, we made the inductive hypothesis and said, \"okay then, let's assume for a second a 40-year-old can vote. We don't know for sure, but let's say she can. Now, if that's indeed true, can a 41-year-old also vote? The answer is yes.\" We might have said, \"okay then, let's assume for a second a 7-year-old can vote. We don't know for sure, but let's say she can. Now, if that's indeed true, can an 8-year-old also vote? The answer is yes.\" Note carefully that we did _not_ say that 8-year-olds can vote! We merely said that _if_ 7-year-olds can, why then 8-year-olds must be able to as well. Remember that X=Y is true if either X is false or Y is true (or both). In the 7/8-year-old example, the premise X turns out to be false, so this doesn't rule out our implication. \nThe result is a row of falling dominos, up to whatever number we wish. Say we want to verify that a **25-year-old** can vote. Can we be sure? Well: \n1. If a 24-year-old can vote, then that would sure prove it (by     the inductive step). \n2. So now we need to verify that a 24-year-old can vote. Can he?     Well, if a 23-year-old can vote, then that would sure prove it     (by the inductive step). \n3. Now everything hinges on whether a 23-year-old can vote.     Can he? Well, if a 22-year-old can vote, then that would sure     prove it (by the inductive step). \n4. So it comes down to whether a 22-year-old can vote. Can he?     Well, if a 21-year-old can vote, then that would sure prove it     (by the inductive step). \n5. And now we need to verify whether a 21-year-old can vote.     Can he? Yes (by the base case). \n236 CHAPTER 9. PROOF \n**Example 2** \nA famous story tells of Carl Friedrich Gauss, perhaps the most brilliant mathematician of all time, getting in trouble one day as a schoolboy. As punishment, he was sentenced to tedious work: adding together all the numbers from 1 to 100. To his teacher's astonishment, he came up with the correct answer in a moment, not because he was quick at adding integers, but because he recognized a trick. The first number on the list (1) and the last (100) add up to 101. So do the second number (2) and the second-to-last (99). So do 3 and 98, and so do 4 and 97, _etc._ , all the way up to 50 and \n51. So really what you have here is 50 different sums of 101 each, so the answer is 50 x 101 = 5050. In general, if you add the numbers from 1 to x, where x is any integer at all, you'll get x 2 sums of x + 1 \neach, so the answer will be x(x 2 +1). \nNow, use mathematical induction to prove that Gauss was right \n( _i.e._ , that \n x i=1 \n i = x(x 2 +1) ) for all numbers x. \nFirst we have to cast our problem as a predicate about natural numbers. This is easy: we say \"let P(n) be the proposition that ^ n \ni=1 \n i = n(n 2 +1) .\" \nThen, we satisfy the requirements of induction: \n1. **base case.** We prove that P(1) is true simply by plugging it     in. Setting n = 1 we have \n ^1 \n i=1 \n i = 1(1 + 1)? 2 \n 1 = 1(2)? 2 1 = 1 X \n2. **inductive step.** We now must prove that P(k)=P(k + 1).     Put another way, we _assume_ P(k) is true, and then use that     assumption to prove that P(k + 1) is also true. \n9.3. PROOF BY INDUCTION 237 \n Let's be crystal clear where we're going with this. Assuming that P(k) is true means we can count on the fact that \n 1 + 2 + 3 + * * * + k = \n k(k + 1) 2 . \n What we need to do, then, is prove that P(k + 1) is true, which amounts to proving that \n 1 + 2 + 3 + * * * + (k + 1) = ( \n k + 1)((k + 1) + 1) 2 . \n Very well. First we make the inductive hypothesis, which allows us to assume: \n 1 + 2 + 3 + * * * + k = k(k + 1) 2 \n . \n The rest is just algebra. We add k + 1 to both sides of the equation, then multiply things out and factor it all together. Watch carefully: \n 1 + 2 + 3 + * * * + k + (k + 1) = k(k + 1) 2 \n + (k + 1) \n = 1 2 k^2 + 1 2 k + k + 1 \n = 1 2 k^2 + 3 2 k + 1 \n = \n k^2 + 3k + 2 2 = ( \n k + 1)(k + 2) 2 = ( \n k + 1)((k + 1) + 1) 2 \n. X \n3. **conclusion.** Therefore, n >= 1 P(n). \n**Example 3** \nAnother algebra one. You learned in middle school that (ab)n^ = anbn. Prove this by mathematical induction. \nSolution: Let P(n) be the proposition that (ab)n^ = anbn. \n238 CHAPTER 9. PROOF \n1. **base case.** We prove that P(1) is true simply by plugging it     in. Setting n = 1 we have \n (ab)^1 =? a^1 b^1 ab = ab X \n2. **inductive step.** We now must prove that P(k)=P(k + 1).     Put another way, we _assume_ P(k) is true, and then use that     assumption to prove that P(k + 1) is also true.     Let's be crystal clear where we're going with this. Assuming     that P(k) is true means we can count on the fact that \n (ab)k^ = akbk. \n What we need to do, then, is prove that P(k + 1) is true, which amounts to proving that \n (ab)k+1^ = ak+1bk+1. \n Now we know by the very definition of exponents that: \n (ab)k+1^ = ab(ab)k. \n Adding in our inductive hypothesis then lets us determine: \n (ab)k+1^ = ab(ab)k = ab * akbk = a * ak^ * b * bk = ak+1bk+1^ X \n3. **conclusion.** Therefore, n >= 1 P(n). \n9.3. PROOF BY INDUCTION 239 \n**Example 4** \nLet's switch gears and talk about structures. Prove that the number of leaves in a perfect binary tree is one more than the number of internal nodes. \nSolution: let P(n) be the proposition that a perfect binary tree of height n has one more leaf than internal node. That is, if lk is the number of _l_ eaves in a tree of height k, and ik is the number of _i_ nternal nodes in a tree of height k, let P(n) be the proposition that ln = in + 1. \n1. **base case.** We prove that P(0) is true simply by inspection.     If we have a tree of height 0, then it has only one node (the     root). This sole node is a leaf, and is not an internal node. So     this tree has 1 leaf, and 0 internal nodes, and so l 0 = i 0 + 1.     X \n2. **inductive step.** We now must prove that P(k)=P(k + 1).     Put another way, we _assume_ P(k) is true, and then use that     assumption to prove that P(k + 1) is also true.     Let's be crystal clear where we're going with this. Assuming     that P(k) is true means we can count on the fact that \n lk = ik + 1. \n What we need to do, then, is prove that P(k + 1) is true, which amounts to proving that \n lk+1 = ik+1 + 1. \n We begin by noting that the number of nodes on level k of a perfect binary tree is 2 k. This is because the root is only one node, it has two children (giving 2 nodes on level 1), both those children have two children (giving 4 nodes on level 2), all four of those children have two children (giving 8 nodes on level 3), etc. Therefore, lk = 2k, and lk+1 = 2k+1. Further, we observe that ik+1 = ik + lk: this is just how trees work. In words, suppose we have a perfect binary tree of \n240 CHAPTER 9. PROOF \n height k, and we add another level of nodes to it, making it a perfect binary tree of height k + 1. Then all of the first tree's nodes (whether internal or leaves) become internal nodes of bigger tree. Combining these two facts, we have ik+1 = ik + 2k. By the inductive hypothesis, we assume that 2 k^ = ik + </passage>"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<tool_call>\\n{\"arguments\": {\"queries\": ['What advice would you give to someone attempting to prove a proposition using mathematical induction?', 'How can one effectively approach and solve a problem using mathematical induction?', 'Are there any common mistakes or pitfalls to avoid when using mathematical induction?'], \"name\": \"ExpertQAExtractor\"}}\\n</tool_call>"}]}

This works out to 256, but we can't actually store the number 256 in a byte if we're using the bit pattern 000000002 (or 0016 ) to represent zero. The highest value would be 111111112 (or FF 16 ), which is 25610. How do we store a number larger than that? Simply use more than one byte, of course. If we used two bytes of memory, and treated them as concatenated one after the other, that would give us 16 bits, allowing us to store up to the number 00000000000000002 = FFFF 16 = 65,535 10. We'd call one of these bytes -- the one representing the 20 's place up to the 27 's place -- the least significant _byte_ , and the other one -- containing places 28 through 215 -- the most significant byte. Extending to more than two bytes to accommodate even larger numbers is done in the obvious way. \n7.4. BINARY (BASE 2) 183 \n**Binary representation schemes** \nThat's mostly all there is to it. But there's one thing we haven't discussed yet, and that's _negative_ numbers. We know how to represent any positive number (or zero) with an ordinary place value scheme. But how do we store a number like - 5? \nThere are three different schemes for treating negative numbers, each with its strengths and weaknesses. \n**Unsigned** \nThe simplest scheme is called **unsigned** , and it simply means that we don't _allow_ negative numbers. For one byte, we have 256 different bit patterns at our disposal, and we might just choose to allocate them all to represent positive numbers, so as to get the widest range. This makes sense for, say, a C++ program variable called heightInInches which we know can never meaningfully be negative (no one has a negative height). \nThe advantage of this scheme is simply that we can represent the greatest possible range of positive numbers, which is sometimes the goal. Each of the alternative schemes carves off a chunk of these available bit patterns and devotes them to representing negative numbers, leaving fewer left over for positive numbers. There's no free lunch: you have to decide how you want to \"spend\" your available bit patterns depending on what values you need to represent. \n**Sign-magnitude** \nThe **sign-magnitude** scheme is probably the first thing you'd think of to solve the negative number representation problem. We need to store the sign of the number somehow, and a sign is inherently a two-valued thing (either positive or negative), so why not peel off one of the bits and use it to represent the sign? The remaining bits can then be used in the ordinary way to represent the magnitude of the number. \nThe way this is most often done is to take the left-most bit and use it as the **sign bit**. This bit now has _no other meaning_. It \n184 CHAPTER 7. NUMBERS \ncan't \"double\" as the 128's place, because then there'd be no way to distinguish between, say, 129 and - 129 (each would be represented with 10000001 .) No, the sign bit must be considered \"spent money,\" and its expressive power cannot be reclaimed to also represent part of the magnitude. By convention, if the sign bit is 0 this represents a _positive_ number, and a sign bit of 1 represents a _negative_ number. (That might seem counterintuitive, but hey, that's the way it is.) \nSo this number in sign-magnitude: \n 0 0100110 \nrepresents the decimal number 38. That's because the sign bit (bolded, on the far left) is 0, which means the number is positive. The magnitude of the number is contained in the other 7 bits, which gives 32 + 4 + 2 = 38. This number, on the other hand: \n 1 0100110 \nrepresents - 38. The magnitude is the same, but the sign bit is 1 so this pattern now \"means\" a negative number. \nClearly we have reduced our range of positive numbers in exchange for the ability to also store negatives. We have 7 bits of range instead of 8, so instead of 255, our highest possible value is merely \n127. On the other end, the lowest possible value is - 127. \nIf you have sharp eyes, you may have noticed a discrepancy in the counting. With the sign-magnitude approach, we can hold numbers in the range - 127 to 127. But wait: that's only 255 different values, not 256! Why did we lose one value of expressive power? The answer is that the sign-magnitude scheme has _two ways_ of representing _zero_. The bit pattern 00000000 is obviously zero, but so is 10000000 (which you might call \"negative zero.\") Using two different patterns to represent the same value is a little wasteful, but the situation is actually worse than that. Having to account for both patterns means that computer hardware using the signmagnitude scheme is inevitably more complicated. To compare two \n7.4. BINARY (BASE 2) 185 \nbytes to see if they're equal, you'd think we'd just compare each bit position, and if they were all the same, the bytes would be declared equal, otherwise no. Alas, this is no longer quite that simple. The two zero patterns must be considered numerically equal, so our digital logic now has to contain a special case. \"To be equal, all the bits have to be the same... oh, but actually not if the right-most seven are all zeroes in both bytes. In that case, it doesn't matter what the left-most bit contains.\" Maddening. \n**Two's-complement** \nThis shortcoming in the sign-magnitude scheme is remedied with the **two's-complement** scheme, which is the one actually used most often in practice. It'll seem weird at first -- certainly not as intuitive as the first two -- but it leads to a critically important feature that we'll look at shortly. \nFirst, the rules. To interpret a two's-complement number, you: \n1. Look at the left-most bit (just like in sign-magnitude). If     it's a 0, you have a positive number. If it's a 1, you have a     negative number. \n2. If it's a positive number, the other 7 bits give you the mag-     nitude (just like in sign-magnitude). \n3. If, however, it's a negative number, then to discover the mag-     nitude of that negative number you must _flip all the bits and_     _add one_. This will give you a positive number which is the     absolute value of your negative number. \nEasy example: take the byte 00100110. The left-most bit is a 0, which means it's a positive number, and as we discovered above, the remaining 7 bits give a magnitude of 38. So this is the number 38. \nHarder example: take the byte 10100110. The left-most bit is a 1, which means it's negative. Okay: negative _what_? How do we find the magnitude? Well, we \"flip\" all the bits ( _i.e._ , invert each one \n186 CHAPTER 7. NUMBERS \nfrom 0 to 1 or vice versa) to get: \n 01011001 \nand then add one to the result: \n 1 01011001 + 1 01011010 \nThis black magic produces the value 010110102 , which converts to 9010. **This means that the original number, 10100110 , corresponds to the value -90.** \n\"Flipping all the bits and adding one\" is the cookbook procedure for taking the complement (negative) of a number in the two'scomplement scheme. It works in reverse, too. Let's start with 90 this time and crank through the process again, making sure we get -90. \nStart with the binary representation of 9010 : \n 01011010 \nFlip all the bits to get: 10100101 \nand finally add one to the result: \n 1 10100101 + 1 10100110 \nWe get 10100110 , which was precisely the number we originally began with, and which we have already determined represents -90. \nNow you may ask what we gain from all this. Surely this scheme is considerably more convoluted than the simple idea of reserving one bit as a sign bit, and treating the rest as a magnitude. But it turns out there is indeed a method to the madness. Strange as \n7.4. BINARY (BASE 2) 187 \nit sounds, a two's-complement representation scheme allows us to _perform addition and subtraction with a single operation._ \nIn first grade (or so), you learned the procedure for adding multidigit numbers, which we've followed several times in this chapter. It involves adding the digits right-to-left and possibly \"carrying.\" Then in second grade (or so), you learned the procedure for _subtracting_ multi-digit numbers. It involves subtracting the digits right-to-left and possibly \"borrowing.\" If you're like me, you found adding easier than subtracting. It's easy to just carry the one, but to borrow requires looking at the digit to the left, making sure that you _can_ borrow from it ( _i.e._ , that it's not already 0), borrowing from further left until you actually find an available non-zero value, hoping the number on the bottom is actually less than the one on the top (because otherwise you have to switch the order and then add a negative sign to the result), and keeping all of that straight as you march down the line. \nEven if you didn't find subtracting more difficult than adding, though, you can't argue that it's still a completely _different_ algorithm, with different rules to follow. In computer hardware, we have to implement different circuitry to perform each operation, which is more difficult, costly, error-prone, and power-draining. \nThe wonderful thing about two's-complement, however, is that with this scheme we actually _never need to use the subtraction algorithm._ If we want to subtract two numbers -- say, 24 - 37 -- we can instead take the complement of the second number and then add them. Instead of 24 - 37 we compute 24 + (-37). \nLet's see it in action. Using conversion procedures, we can figure out that 2410 is: \n 00011000 \nand that _positive_ 3710 is: \n 00100101 \nIf we wanted to compute 24 + 37, we'd just add these. But instead we're looking for 24 - 37 , so we'll take the complement of 37 to find \n188 CHAPTER 7. NUMBERS \n- 37. Flip all the bits of 37: \n 11011010 \nand add one: 1 1011010 + 1 1 1011011 \nand so now we've determined that in the two's-complement scheme, - 37 is represented by 110110112. \nWe're now ready to compute 24 + (-37): \n 1 1 \n00011000 - this is (^2410) + 11011011 - this is - (^3710) 11110011 So we have our two's-complement answer, 11110011. What value does that correspond to? Well, the left-most bit is a 1, so it's a negative number. To find out what it's the negative _of_ , flip all the bits and add one: 0 0001100 - flip the bits to get + 1 - add one 0 0001101 This is positive 13, which means the number we inverted to get it -- 11110011 -- must represent - 13. And that is indeed the correct answer, for 24 - 37 = - 13. One last word on two's-complement: what is the _range_ of numbers we can represent? It turns out to be -128 to 127. The highest value is 01111111 , which is 127. You might think the lowest value would be represented as 11111111 , but if you work it out, you'll find that this is actually the number - 1. The lowest number is actually the bit pattern 10000000 , which is - 128. **Overflow** One last sticky detail we need to cover has to do with **overflow**. When we add two numbers, there is the possibility that the result \n7.4. BINARY (BASE 2) 189 \nwill contain one more digit than the original numbers did. You've probably seen this on a hand calculator when you press \"=\" and get an \"E\" (for \"error\") in the display. If there are only ten digits on your display, adding two ten-digit numbers will (sometimes) result in an eleven-digit number that your calculator can't display, and it's alerting you to that fact so you don't misinterpret the result. Here, we might add two 8-bit quantities and end up with a 9-bit quantity that can't fit in one byte. This situation is called overflow, and we need to detect when it occurs. \nThe rules for detecting overflow are different depending on the scheme. For _unsigned_ numbers, the rule is simple: if a 1 is carried out from the MSB (far left-side), then we have overflow. So if I were to try to add 15510 and 10810 : \n 1 1 1 1 \n10011011 - (^15510) + 01101100 - (^10810) 1 00001111 then I get a carry out left into the 9th digit.

In other words, how does the third statement of the theorem read when a = 0? Does our proof require some extra care when a = 0? Compare your answers with the similar situation for the second row operation. (See Exercise SSLE.T20.) \n \u0004 \nTheorem EOPSS is the necessary tool to complete our strategy for solving systems of equations. We will use equation operations to move from one system to another, all the while keeping the solution set the same. With the right sequence of operations, we will arrive at a simpler equation to solve. The next two examples illustrate this idea, while saving some of the details for later. Example US Three equations, one solution We solve the following system by a sequence of equation operations. \n x 1 + 2x 2 + 2x 3 = 4 x 1 + 3x 2 + 3x 3 = 5 2 x 1 + 6x 2 + 5x 3 = 6 \n a = -1 times equation 1, add to equation 2: \n x 1 + 2x 2 + 2x 3 = 4 0 x 1 + 1x 2 + 1x 3 = 1 \n SSS S L E B e e z e r : A F i r s t C o u r s e i n L i n e a r A l g e b r a 13 \n 2 x 1 + 6x 2 + 5x 3 = 6 \n a = -2 times equation 1, add to equation 3: \n x 1 + 2x 2 + 2x 3 = 4 0 x 1 + 1x 2 + 1x 3 = 1 0 x 1 + 2x 2 + 1x 3 = - 2 \n a = -2 times equation 2, add to equation 3: \n x 1 + 2x 2 + 2x 3 = 4 0 x 1 + 1x 2 + 1x 3 = 1 0 x 1 + 0x 2 - 1 x 3 = - 4 \n a = -1 times equation 3: \n x 1 + 2x 2 + 2x 3 = 4 0 x 1 + 1x 2 + 1x 3 = 1 0 x 1 + 0x 2 + 1x 3 = 4 \n which can be written more clearly as \nx 1 + 2x 2 + 2x 3 = 4 x 2 + x 3 = 1 x 3 = 4 This is now a very easy system of equations to solve. The third equation requires that x 3 = 4 to be true. Making this substitution into equation 2 we arrive at x 2 = -3, and finally, substituting these values of x 2 and x 3 into the first equation, we find that x 1 = 2. Note too that this is the only solution to this final system of equations, since we were forced to choose these values to make the equations true. Since we performed equation operations on each system to obtain the next one in the list, all of the systems listed here are all equivalent to each other by Theorem EOPSS. Thus (x 1 , x 2 , x 3 ) = (2, - 3 , 4) is the unique solution to the original system of equations (and all of the other intermediate systems of equations listed as we transformed one into another). 4 Example IS Three equations, infinitely many solutions The following system of equations made an appearance earlier in this section (Example NSE), where we listed one of its solutions. Now, we will try to find all of the solutions to this system. Do not concern yourself too much about why we choose this particular sequence of equation operations, just believe that the work we do is all correct. x 1 + 2x 2 + 0x 3 + x 4 = 7 x 1 + x 2 + x 3 - x 4 = 3 3 x 1 + x 2 + 5x 3 - 7 x 4 = 1 \n a = -1 times equation 1, add to equation 2: \n x 1 + 2x 2 + 0x 3 + x 4 = 7 0 x 1 - x 2 + x 3 - 2 x 4 = - 4 3 x 1 + x 2 + 5x 3 - 7 x 4 = 1 \n a = -3 times equation 1, add to equation 3: \n x 1 + 2x 2 + 0x 3 + x 4 = 7 \nSSS S L E B e e z e r : A F i r s t C o u r s e i n L i n e a r A l g e b r a 14 \n 0 x 1 - x 2 + x 3 - 2 x 4 = - 4 0 x 1 - 5 x 2 + 5x 3 - 10 x 4 = - 20 \na = -5 times equation 2, add to equation 3: \n x 1 + 2x 2 + 0x 3 + x 4 = 7 0 x 1 - x 2 + x 3 - 2 x 4 = - 4 0 x 1 + 0x 2 + 0x 3 + 0x 4 = 0 \na = -1 times equation 2: \n x 1 + 2x 2 + 0x 3 + x 4 = 7 0 x 1 + x 2 - x 3 + 2x 4 = 4 0 x 1 + 0x 2 + 0x 3 + 0x 4 = 0 \na = -2 times equation 2, add to equation 1: \n x 1 + 0x 2 + 2x 3 - 3 x 4 = - 1 0 x 1 + x 2 - x 3 + 2x 4 = 4 0 x 1 + 0x 2 + 0x 3 + 0x 4 = 0 \nwhich can be written more clearly as \nx 1 + 2x 3 - 3 x 4 = - 1 x 2 - x 3 + 2x 4 = 4 0 = 0 What does the equation 0 = 0 mean? We can choose any values for x 1 , x 2 , x 3 , x 4 and this equation will be true, so we only need to consider further the first two equations, since the third is true no matter what. We can analyze the second equation without consideration of the variable x 1. It would appear that there is considerable latitude in how we can choose x 2 , x 3 , x 4 and make this equation true. Let us choose x 3 and x 4 to be anything we please, say x 3 = a and x 4 = b. Now we can take these arbitrary values for x 3 and x 4 , substitute them in equation 1, to obtain \n x 1 + 2a - 3 b = - 1 x 1 = - 1 - 2 a + 3b \nSimilarly, equation 2 becomes \nx 2 - a + 2b = 4 x 2 = 4 + a - 2 b So our arbitrary choices of values for x 3 and x 4 (a and b) translate into specific values of x 1 and x 2. The lone solution given in Example NSE was obtained by choosing a = 2 and b = 1. Now we can easily and quickly find many more (infinitely more). Suppose we choose a = 5 and b = -2, then we compute \n x 1 = - 1 - 2(5) + 3(-2) = - 17 x 2 = 4 + 5 - 2(-2) = 13 \nand you can verify that (x 1 , x 2 , x 3 , x 4 ) = (- 17 , 13 , 5 , -2) makes all three equations true. The entire solution set is written as \nS = { (- 1 - 2 a + 3b, 4 + a - 2 b, a, b)| a  C, b  C} It would be instructive to finish off your study of this example by taking the general form of the solutions given in this set and substituting them into each of the \nSSS S L E B e e z e r : A F i r s t C o u r s e i n L i n e a r A l g e b r a 15 \nthree equations and verify that they are true in each case (Exercise SSLE.M40). 4 \nIn the next section we will describe how to use equation operations to systematically solve any system of linear equations.

Then the index di is a pivot column. It will be easy in this case to use the equation represented by row i to write an expression for the variable xdi. It will be a linear function of the variables xf 1 , xf 2 , xf 3 , xf 4 (notice that f 5 = 8 does not reference a variable, but does tell us the final column is not a pivot column). We will now construct these three expressions. Notice that using subscripts upon subscripts takes some getting used to.

We refer to xf 1 = x 2 , xf 2 = x 5 , xf 3 = x 6 and xf 4 = x 7 as \"free\" (or \"independent\") variables since they are allowed to assume any possible combination of values that we can imagine and we can continue on to build a solution to the system by solving individual equations for the values of the other (\"dependent\") variables. Each element of the set D = {d 1 , d 2 , d 3 } = { 1 , 3 , 4 } is the index of a variable. We refer to the variables xd 1 = x 1 , xd 2 = x 3 and xd 3 = x 4 as \"dependent\" variables \nSST S S B e e z e r : A F i r s t C o u r s e i n L i n e a r A l g e b r a 38 \nsince they depend on the independent variables. More precisely, for each possible choice of values for the independent variables we get exactly one set of values for the dependent variables that combine to form a solution of the system.

This systematic approach to solving a system of equations will allow us to create a precise description of the solution set for any consistent system once we have found the reduced row-echelon form of the augmented matrix. It will work just as well when the set of free variables is empty and we get just a single solution. And we could program a computer to do it! Now have a whack at Archetype J (Exercise TSS.C10), mimicking the discussion in this example. We'll still be here when you get back. 4 \nUsing the reduced row-echelon form of the augmented matrix of a system of equations to determine the nature of the solution set of the system is a very key idea. So let us look at one more example like the last one. But first a definition, and then the example. We mix our metaphors a bit when we call variables free versus dependent. Maybe we should call dependent variables \"enslaved\"? \nDefinition IDV Independent and Dependent Variables Suppose A is the augmented matrix of a consistent system of linear equations and B is a row-equivalent matrix in reduced row-echelon form. Suppose j is the index of a pivot column of B. Then the variable xj is dependent. A variable that is not dependent is called independent or free. \u0003 \nIf you studied this definition carefully, you might wonder what to do if the system has n variables and column n + 1 is a pivot column? We will see shortly, by Theorem RCLS, that this never happens for a consistent system. \nExample FDV Free and dependent variables Consider the system of five equations in five variables, \n x 1 - x 2 - 2 x 3 + x 4 + 11x 5 = 13 x 1 - x 2 + x 3 + x 4 + 5x 5 = 16 2 x 1 - 2 x 2 + x 4 + 10x 5 = 21 2 x 1 - 2 x 2 - x 3 + 3x 4 + 20x 5 = 38 2 x 1 - 2 x 2 + x 3 + x 4 + 8x 5 = 22 \nwhose augmented matrix row-reduces to       1 - 1 0 0 3 6 0 0 1 0 - 2 1 0 0 0 1 4 9 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \n       \nColumns 1, 3 and 4 are pivot columns, so D = { 1 , 3 , 4 }. From this we know that the variables x 1 , x 3 and x 4 will be dependent variables, and each of the r = 3 nonzero rows of the row-reduced matrix will yield an expression for one of these \n SST S S B e e z e r : A F i r s t C o u r s e i n L i n e a r A l g e b r a 39 \n three variables. The set F is all the remaining column indices, F = { 2 , 5 , 6 }. The column index 6 in F means that the final column is not a pivot column, and thus the system is consistent (Theorem RCLS). The remaining indices in F indicate free variables, so x 2 and x 5 (the remaining variables) are our free variables. The resulting three equations that describe our solution set are then, (xd 1 = x 1 ) x 1 = 6 + x 2 - 3 x 5 (xd 2 = x 3 ) x 3 = 1 + 2x 5 (xd 3 = x 4 ) x 4 = 9 - 4 x 5 Make sure you understand where these three equations came from, and notice how the location of the pivot columns determined the variables on the left-hand side of each equation. We can compactly describe the solution set as, \n S = \n    \n   \n      \n 6 + x 2 - 3 x 5 x 2 1 + 2x 5 9 - 4 x 5 x 5 \n      \n | | | | | | | | | \n x 2 , x 5  C \n    \n   \nNotice how we express the freedom for x 2 and x 5 : x 2 , x 5  C. 4 Sets are an important part of algebra, and we have seen a few already. Being comfortable with sets is important for understanding and writing proofs. If you have not already, pay a visit now to Section SET. We can now use the values of m, n, r, and the independent and dependent variables to categorize the solution sets for linear systems through a sequence of theorems. Through the following sequence of proofs, you will want to consult three proof techniques. See Proof Technique E, Proof Technique N, Proof Technique CP. First we have an important theorem that explores the distinction between consistent and inconsistent linear systems. Theorem RCLS Recognizing Consistency of a Linear System Suppose A is the augmented matrix of a system of linear equations with n variables. Suppose also that B is a row-equivalent matrix in reduced row-echelon form with r nonzero rows. Then the system of equations is inconsistent if and only if column n + 1 of B is a pivot column. \n Proof. (=) The first half of the proof begins with the assumption that column n + 1 of B is a pivot column. Then the leading 1 of row r is located in column n + 1 of B and so row r of B begins with n consecutive zeros, finishing with the leading 1. This is a representation of the equation 0 = 1, which is false. Since this equation is false for any collection of values we might choose for the variables, there are no solutions for the system of equations, and the system is inconsistent. (=) For the second half of the proof, we wish to show that if we assume the system is inconsistent, then column n + 1 of B is a pivot column. But instead of proving this directly, we will form the logically equivalent statement that is the contrapositive, and prove that instead (see Proof Technique CP). Turning the implication around, and negating each portion, we arrive at the logically equivalent statement: if column n + 1 of B is not a pivot column, then the system of equations is consistent. If column n + 1 of B is not a pivot column, the leading 1 for row r is located somewhere in columns 1 through n. Then every preceding row's leading 1 is also located in columns 1 through n. In other words, since the last leading 1 is not in the last column, no leading 1 for any row is in the last column, due to the echelon layout of the leading 1's (Definition RREF). We will now construct a solution to the system by setting each dependent variable to the entry of the final column in the row with the corresponding leading 1, and setting each free variable to zero. That \n SST S S B e e z e r : A F i r s t C o u r s e i n L i n e a r A l g e b r a 40 \nsentence is pretty vague, so let us be more precise. Using our notation for the sets D and F from the reduced row-echelon form (Definition RREF): xdi = [B]i,n+1 , 1 <= i <= r xfi = 0, 1 <= i <= n - r These values for the variables make the equations represented by the first r rows of B all true (convince yourself of this). Rows numbered greater than r (if any) are all zero rows, hence represent the equation 0 = 0 and are also all true. We have now identified one solution to the system represented by B, and hence a solution to the system represented by A (Theorem REMES). So we can say the system is consistent (Definition CS). \u0004 \nThe beauty of this theorem being an equivalence is that we can unequivocally test to see if a system is consistent or inconsistent by looking at just a single entry of the reduced row-echelon form matrix. We could program a computer to do it! Notice that for a consistent system the row-reduced augmented matrix has n + 1  F , so the largest element of F does not refer to a variable. Also, for an inconsistent system, n + 1  D, and it then does not make much sense to discuss whether or not variables </passage>"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<tool_call>\\n{\"arguments\": {\"queries\": ['What is the purpose of using the reduced row-echelon form of an augmented matrix to determine the solution set of a system of equations?', 'How do we identify dependent variables in a system of equations?', 'Can you provide an example of a system of equations with a consistent and an inconsistent solution set?'], \"name\": \"ExpertQAExtractor\"}}\\n</tool_call>"}]}

A proof can't even get off the ground without axioms. For instance, in step 1 of the above proof, we noted that either A or B must be true, and so if B isn't true, then A must be. But we couldn't have taken this step without knowing that disjunctive syllogism is a valid form of reasoning. It's not important to know all the technical names of the rules that I included in parentheses. But it is important to see that we made use of an axiom of reasoning on every step, and that if any of those axioms were incorrect, it could lead to a faulty conclusion. \nWhen you create a valid proof, the result is a new bit of knowledge called a **theorem** which can be used in future proofs. Think of a theorem like a subroutine in programming: a separate bit of code that does a job and can be invoked at will in the course of doing other things. One theorem we learned in chapter 2 was the distributive property of sets; that is, that X  (Y  Z) = (X  Y)  (X  Z). This can be proven through the use of Venn diagrams, but once you've proven it, it's accepted to be true, and can be used as a \"given\" in future proofs. \n**9.2 Types of proof** \nThere are a number of accepted \"styles\" of doing proofs. Here are some important ones: \n**Direct proof** \nThe examples we've used up to now have been **direct proof** s. This is where you start from what's known and proceed directly by positive steps towards your conclusion. \nDirect proofs remind me of a game called \"word ladders,\" invented by Lewis Carroll, that you might have played as a child: \n WARM |||| ???? |||| \n228 CHAPTER 9. PROOF \n COLD \nYou start with one word (like WARM) and you have to come up with a sequence of words, _each of which differs from the previous by only one letter_ , such that you eventually reach the ending word (like COLD). It's sort of like feeling around in the dark: \n WARM WART WALT WILT WILD |||| .... \nThis attempt seemed promising at first, but now it looks like it's going nowhere. (\"WOLD?\" \"CILD?\" Hmm....) After starting over and playing around with it for a while, you might stumble upon: \n WARM WORM WORD CORD COLD \nThis turned out to be a pretty direct path: for each step, the letter we changed was exactly what we needed it to be for the target word COLD. Sometimes, though, you have to meander away from the target a little bit to find a solution, like going from BLACK to WHITE: \n BLACK CLACK CRACK TRACK TRICK TRICE \n9.2. TYPES OF PROOF 229 \n TRITE WRITE WHITE \nHere, we had to temporarily change our first letter three different times -- two of which seemingly brought us no nearer to WHITE -- in order to successfully forge a path through the tangled forest. \nKnowing which direction to set out on is a matter of intuition plus trial and error. Given the axioms of any system (whether algebra, predicate logic, sets, _etc._ ) there are an unfathomable number of different ways to proceed. The vast majority of them are bound to lead to dead ends. This is why a valid proof, when it is finished, is often an elegant and beautiful thing. It's a thin braid of jewels glistening in the midst of a whole lot of mud. \n**Indirect proof** \nAlso known as a **proof by contradiction** or **_reductio ad absurdum_** , the **indirect proof** starts in a completely opposite way. It says, \"okay, I'm trying to prove X. Well, suppose for the sake of argument I assume that the opposite -- _not_ X -- is true. Where would that lead me?\" If you follow all the rules and it leads you to a contradiction, this tells you that the original assumption of !X must have been false. And this in turn proves that X must be true. \nWe do this all the time in our thinking. Say you're driving down the highway. How do you _know_ that the alternator in your car engine is working? A direct proof would require that you open the hood and examine the part, testing to ensure it works properly. An indirect proof simply says, \"well, suppose it _weren't_ working properly. Then, my car engine wouldn't operate. But here I am, driving down the road, and the engine obviously _does_ operate, so that tells me that the alternator must be working properly.\" \nOne of the most famous indirect proofs dates from Euclid's _Elements_ in 300 B.C. It proves that the square root of 2 is an irrational number, a great surprise to mathematicians at the time (most of whom doubted the very existence of irrational numbers). Remem\n230 CHAPTER 9. PROOF \nber that an irrational number is one that _cannot_ be expressed as the ratio of two integers, no matter what the integers are. \nProving this directly seems pretty hard, since how do you prove that there _aren't_ any two integers whose ratio is \n 2 , no matter how hard you looked? I mean, 534,927 and 378,250 are pretty dang close: \n ( 534 , 927 378 , 250 \n ) 2 = 2. 000005. \nHow could we possibly prove that no matter how hard we look, we can never find a pair that will give it to us exactly? \nOne way is to assume that \n 2 _is_ a rational number, and then prove that down that path lies madness. It goes like this. Suppose \n 2 is rational, after all. That means that there must be two integers, call them a and b, whose ratio is exactly equal to \n  2 : \n a b = \n  2. \nThis, then, is the starting point for our indirect proof. We're going to proceed under this assumption and see where it leads us. \nBy the way, it's clear that we could always reduce this fraction to lowest terms in case it's not already. For instance, if a = 6 and b = 4, then our fraction would be 64 , which is the same as 32 , so we could just say a = 3 and b = 2 and start over. Bottom line: if 2 is rational, then we can find two integers a and b that have no common factor (if they do have a common factor, we'll just divide it out of both of them and go with the new numbers) whose ratio is \n  2. \nOkay then. But now look what happens. Suppose we square both \n9.3. PROOF BY INDUCTION 231 \nsides of the equation (a perfectly legal thing to do): a b \n = \n  2 ( a b \n ) 2 = ( \n  2)^2 \n a^2 b^2 = 2 a^2 = 2b^2. \nNow if a^2 equals 2 times something, then a^2 is an even number. But a^2 can't be even unless a itself is even. (Think hard about that one.) This proves, then, that a is even. Very well. It must be equal to twice some other integer. Let's call that c. We know that a = 2c, where c is another integer. Substitute that into the last equation and we get: \n (2c)^2 = 2b^2 4 c^2 = 2b^2 2 c^2 = b^2. \nSo it looks like b^2 must be an even number as well (since it's equal to 2 times something), and therefore b is also even. But wait a minute. We started by saying that a and b _had no common factor_. And now we've determined that they're both even numbers! This means they both have a factor of 2, which contradicts what we started with. The only thing we introduced that was questionable was the notion that there _are_ two integers a and b whose ratio was equal to \n 2 to begin with. That must be the part that's faulty then. Therefore, \n  2 is not an irrational number. Q.E.D. \n**9.3 Proof by induction** \nOne of the most powerful methods of proof -- and one of the most difficult to wrap your head around -- is called **mathematical induction** , or just \"induction\" for short. I like to call it \"proof by \n232 CHAPTER 9. PROOF \nrecursion,\" because this is exactly what it is. Remember that we discussed recursion in the context of rooted trees (see p.116). A tree can be thought of as a node with several children -- each of which are, in turn, trees. Each of _them_ is the root node of a tree comprised of yet smaller trees, and so on and so forth. If you flip back to the left-hand side of Figure 5.16 on p.113, you'll see that A is the root of one tree, and its two children, F and B, are roots of their own smaller trees in turn. If we were to traverse this tree in (say) pre-order, we'd visit the root, then visit the left and right subtrees in turn, treating each of them as their _own_ tree. In this way we've broken up a larger problem (traversing the big tree) into smaller problems (traversing the smaller trees F and B). The A node has very little to do: it just visits itself, then defers all the rest of the work onto its children. This idea of pawning off most of the work onto smaller subproblems _that you trust will work_ is key to the idea of inductive proofs. \nMathematical induction is hard to wrap your head around because it feels like cheating. It seems like you never actually prove anything: you defer all the work to someone else, and then declare victory. But the chain of reasoning, though delicate, is strong as iron. \n**Casting the problem in the right form** \nLet's examine that chain. The first thing you have to be able to do is express the thing you're trying to prove as _a predicate about natural numbers_. In other words, you need to form a predicate that has one input, which is a natural number. You're setting yourself up to prove that the predicate is true _for all natural numbers._ (Or at least, all natural numbers of at least a certain size.) \nSuppose I want to prove that in the state of Virginia, all legal drinkers can vote. Then I could say \"let Vote(n) be the proposition that a citizen of age n can vote.\" \nIf I want to prove an algebraic identity, like \n x i=1 \n i = x(x 2 +1) , then I \nhave to figure out which variable is the one that needs to vary across the natural numbers. In this case it's the x variable in my equation. \n9.3. PROOF BY INDUCTION 233 \nSo I'll say \"let P(n) be the proposition that \n n i=1 \n i = n(n 2 +1) .\" (The \nchoice of the letter \"n\" isn't important here -- it just needs to be a letter that stands for a number. We could have chosen anything, even sticking with x. Later, we'll use \"k\" as a stand-in, so keep your eyes peeled for that.) \nIf I want to prove that the number of leaves in a perfect binary tree is one more than the number of internal nodes, I'd have to think about which _quantity_ I can parameterize on ( _i.e._ , which quantity I can use for my n.) In this case, I'd probably use the _height_ of the tree. I'd say \"let P(n) be the proposition that the number of leaves in a perfect binary tree of height n is one more than the number of internal nodes.\" \nThese are just examples. In any case, you need to cast your proof in a form that allows you to make statements in terms of the natural numbers. Then you're ready to begin the process of proving by induction that your predicate is true for _all_ the natural numbers. \n**Proof by induction: weak form** \nThere are actually two forms of induction, the weak form and the strong form. Let's look at the **weak form** first. It says: \n1. _If_ a predicate is true for a certain number, \n2. _and_ its being true for some number would reliably mean that     it's also true for the next number ( _i.e._ , one number greater), \n3. _then_ it's true for all numbers. \nAll you have to do is prove those two things, and you've effectively proven it for every case. \nThe first step is called the **base case** , and the \"certain number\" we pick is normally either 0 or 1. The second step, called the **inductive step** , is where all the trouble lies. You have to look really, really carefully at how it's worded, above. We are _not_ assuming \n234 CHAPTER 9. PROOF \nthat the predicate is true for any old number! We are simply considering, _if_ it's true for any old number, whether that would necessarily imply it's also true for the next number. In terms of the predicate, we're asking \"does P(k) imply P(k +1)?\" In other words: \"we aren't sure if P(k) is true. But if it is -- a big \"if,\" of course -- would that logically demand that P(k + 1) was also true?\" If you can prove that it does, then you're in business. </passage>"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<tool_call>\\n{\"arguments\": {\"queries\": ['How can the distributive property of sets, proved in Chapter 2, be applied in future proofs?', 'Can you give an example of a real-world situation where understanding different styles of proof would be useful?', 'How can the idea of \"deferring work onto smaller subproblems\" be applied in problem-solving in other areas?'], \"name\": \"ExpertQAExtractor\"}}\\n</tool_call>"}]}

As you discover useful sources, try to expand your usual research process by experimenting with the techniques and resources included in this chapter. The first and most important determining factor of your research is where you choose to begin. Although there are a great number of credible and useful texts available across different search platforms, I generally encourage my students to begin with two resources: \n**1.** Their college or university's library and its website \n**2.** Google Scholar These resources are not bulletproof, and you can't always find what you need through them. However, their general search functionality and the databases from which they draw tend to be more reliable, specific, and professional. It is quite likely that your argument will be better received if it relies on the kind of sources you discover with these tools. \n##### Your Library \n Although the following information primarily focuses on making good use of your library's online tools, one of the most valuable and underutilized resources at your disposal is the librarians themselves. Do you know if your school has research librarians on staff? Research librarians (or reference librarians) are not only well versed in the research process but also passionate about supporting students in their inquiry. It's also possible that your library offers research support that you can access remotely: many colleges and universities provide librarian support via instant message/chat or email. Some libraries even make video tutorials and do-it-yourself research tips and tricks. The first step in learning how your library will support you is to investigate their website. Although I can't provide specific instruction for the use of your library website--they are all slightly different--I encourage you to spend ten minutes familiarizing yourself with the site, considering the following questions especially:  Does the site have an FAQ section, student support, a librarian chat service, 165 COLLECTED WORKS \nor a DIY link in case you have questions?  Does the site have an integrated search bar (i.e., a search engine that allows you to search some or all databases and the library catalog simultaneously)?  How do you access the \"advanced search\" function of the library's search bar?  Does your account have a folder or reading list to save sources you find?  Is your library a member of a resource-sharing network, like ILLiad or Summit? How do you request a source through this network?  Does your library subscribe to multimedia or digital resource services, like video streaming or e-book libraries?  Does the site offer any citation management support software, like Mendeley or Zotero? Most schools pay subscriptions to databases filled with academic works in addition to owning a body of physical texts (books, DVDs, magazines, etc.). Some schools are members of exchange services for physical texts as well (such as Summit or ILLiad), in which case a network of libraries can provide resources to students at your school. It is worth noting that most library websites use an older form of search technology. You have likely realized that day-to-day search engines like Google will predict what you're searching for, correct your spelling, and automatically return results that your search terms might not have exactly aligned with. For example, I could Google _How many baksetbal players on Jazzz roster_ , and I would still likely get the results I needed. Most library search engines don't do this, so you need to be very deliberate with your search terms. Here are some tips:  Consider synonyms and jargon that might be more likely to yield results. As you research, you will become more fluent in the language of your subject. Keep track of vocabulary that other scholars use, and revise your search terms based on this context-specific language.  Use the Boolean operators? and * for expanded results:  _wom?n_ yields results for _woman, women, womyn,_ and so on  _medic*_ yields results for _medic, medicine, medication, medicinal, medical,_ and so on  Use the advanced search feature to combine search terms, exclude certain results, limit the search terms' applicability, and so on.  Use the filters (usually on the left or right side of the page) to sort for the kinds of sources you want. For example, if you are looking for academic sources, you can filter for \"peer-reviewed articles.\" A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 166 \n##### Other Resources \n As we will continue to discuss, the most useful sources for your research project are not always proper academic, peer-reviewed articles. For instance, if I were writing a paper on the experience of working for United Airlines, a compelling blog post by a flight attendant that speaks to the actual working conditions they experienced might be more appropriate than a data-driven scholarly investigation of the United Airlines consumer trends. You might find that a TED Talk, a published interview, an advertisement, or some other nonacademic source would be useful for your writing. Therefore, it's important that you evaluate all the texts you encounter, being especially careful with texts that some people might see as unreliable. (See \"The CRAAP Test: Evaluating Traditional Sources\" and \"Four Moves and a Habit: Evaluating Web Sources\" for more on evaluating sources.) \n##### Additional Techniques For Discovering Sources \n All it takes is one or two really good sources to get you started. You should keep your perspective wide to catch as much as you can--but if you've found a handful of good sources, the following are tools that can help you find even more:  The author of that perfect article probably got some of their information from somewhere else, just like you. Citation mining is the process of using a text's citations, bibliography, or notes to track down other similar or related sources. Plug the author's citations into your school's library search engine or Google Scholar to see if you have access.  Web of Science is like reverse citation mining: instead of using a text's bibliography to find more sources, you find other sources that cite your text in their bibliographies. Web of Science is a digital archive that shows you connections between different authors and their writing--and not only for science! If you find a good source that is documented in this database, you can see other texts that cite that source.  Bootstrapping is a technique that works best on search engines with detail features, like your library search engine. Search engines tag each text with certain subject keywords. By clicking on those keywords, you can link to other texts tagged with the same keywords, typically according to Library of Congress standards. The first and most important piece of advice I can offer you as you begin to dig into these sources: stay organized. By taking notes and keeping a record of where each idea is coming from, you save yourself a lot of time--and avoid the risk of unintentional plagiarism.

As you sift through sources, you should consider credibility and use value to determine whether a source is right for you. Credibility refers to the reliability and accuracy of the author, their writing, and the publisher. Use value is a broad term that includes whether you should use a text in your research paper as well as how you will use that text. The CRAAP Test will help you explore both credibility and use value, and it's especially useful when evaluating sources that you are carefully considering for use in a paper. In chapter 23, Mike Caulfield offers a faster set of strategies for determining the validity of information you find in your day-to-day life online. \n#### THE CRAAP TEST \n 171 A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT \n Table 22.1 Explaining the initialism CRAAP \n##### Feature Explanation \n##### Currency \n##### (C) \n How recently was the text created?

(Step 1) Now compute 1838 mod 16. This gives us the value     14, which is of course a base 10 number. The equivalent hex     digit is E. So we now write down E to the left of the 3: \nE3 \n4. (Step 2) Dividing 1838 by 16 and taking the floor gives us \n114.

This turns out to be     2, so we write down a 2: \n2E3 \n176 CHAPTER 7. NUMBERS \n6. (Step 2) Computing  114 / 16  produces 7, which is again not     zero, so 7 becomes our new value and we go back once again     to step 2b. \n7. (Step 1) 7 mod 16 is simply 7, so we write it down: \n72E3 \n8. (Step 2) Finally,  7 / 16  is zero, so we go to step 2a and     we're done. The page has 72E3 written on it in big bold     letters, which is the correct answer. \n**Adding hex numbers** \nSuppose we have two hexadecimal numbers, and we want to add them together to get a hexadecimal result. How do we do it? One way is to first convert them both to decimal, then add them like you learned in first grade, then convert the answer back to hex. But we can stay \"natively hex\" as long as we add each pair of digits correctly. \nLet's try it. Suppose we want to compute this sum: \n48 D (^416) +59 2 5 16 ? 16 We proceed in the first-grade way from right to left. Adding the one's-place values, we get 4 + 5 = 9: 48 D (^416) +59 2 5 16 (^916) Easy enough. Now we add the next digit to the left (the sixteen'splace, mind you, not the ten's place) and we find D + 2. Now what in the world is \"D+2\"? It's actually easy: all you have to do is the same thing you did when you were a child and you had to add something like 4 + 5. You hadn't memorized the answer \n7.4. BINARY (BASE 2) 177 \nyet, and so you started with four fingers held up, and counted off \"1... 2... 3... 4... 5,\" sticking up another finger each time. Then, you looked at your hands, and behold! nine fingers. \nWe'll do the same thing here: start with the number \"D,\" and count two additional places: \"E... F.\" The answer is F. That is the number that's two greater than D. Lucky for us, it still fits in one digit. So now we have: \n48 D (^416) +59 2 5 16 F (^916) So far so good. The next pair of digits is 8 + 9. Here's where you want to be careful. You're liable to look at \"8+9\" and immediately say \"17!\" But 8 + 9 is _not_ 17 in hexadecimal. To figure out what it is, we start with the number 8, and count: \"9... A... B... C... D... E... F... 10... 11... \". The answer is \"11,\" which of course is how you write \"seventeen\" in hex. So just like in grade school, we write down 1 and carry the 1: 1 48 D (^416) +59 2 5 16 1 F (^916) Finally, our last digit is 4 + 5, plus the carried 1. We start with four and count off five: \"5... 6... 7... 8... 9.\" Then we add the carry, and count \"... A.\" The answer is A, with no carry, and so we have our final answer: 1 4 8D (^416) + 5 9 2 5 16 **A1F9 16 7.4 Binary (base 2)** The other base we commonly use in computer science is base 2, or **binary**. This is because the basic unit of information in a computer is called a **bit** , which has only two values, conventionally called either \"true\" and \"false\" or \"1\" and \"0\". Numbers (as well \n178 CHAPTER 7. NUMBERS \nas everything else) are ultimately represented as colossal sequences of 1's and 0's, which are of course binary numbers. \nThe rules for interpreting place value are the same: \n 1101012 = 1 x 25 + 1 x 24 + 0 x 23 + 1 x 22 + 0 x 21 + 1 x 20 = 1 x 32 + 1 x 16 + 0 x 8 + 1 x 4 + 0 x 2 + 1 x 1 = 5310. \nSo in binary we have a one's-place, a two's-place, a four's-place, an eight's-place, and so on. We call the right-most place the **least significant bit (LSB)** and the left-most the **most significant bit (MSB)**. \nCounting up from zero is really just the same as any other base, although it feels a little strange in binary because you \"roll over\" so often: \n 02 zero 12 one 102 two 112 three 1002 four 1012 five 1102 six 1112 seven 10002 eight 10012 nine .. . \n .. . \n**Converting to and from decimal** \nConverting from binary to decimal was demonstrated above (with 1101012 = 53 10 .) To go the other way, we follow the algorithm from page 174. Let's try it for the decimal number 49: \n1. (Step 1) We first compute 49 mod 2. Doing \"mod 2\" is easy:     you just see whether the number is even or odd. In this case,     it's odd, so the remainder is a 1: \n7.4. BINARY (BASE 2) 179 \n1 \n2. (Step 2) Now divide 49 by 2 and take the floor, which gives      49 / 2  = 24. It's not zero, so we perform step 2b: make 24     our new value, move our pencil to the left of the 1, and go     back to step 1. \n3. (Step 1) Compute 24 mod 2. Since 24 is even, this is zero,     which we write down to the left of the 1: \n01 \n4. (Step 2) Divide 24 by 2 and take the floor, which gives  24 /     2  = 12. Make 12 our new value, move our pencil to the left     of the 0, and go back to step 1. \n5. (Step 1) Compute 12 mod 2. Since 12 is even, this is zero,     which we write down: \n001 \n6. (Step 2) Divide 12 by 2 and take the floor, which gives  12 /     2  = 6. Make 6 our new value, move our pencil to the left of     the 0, and go back to step 1. \n7. (Step 1) Compute 6 mod 2. Since 6 is even, this is zero, which     we write down: \n0001 \n8. (Step 2) Divide 6 by 2 and take the floor, which gives  6 / 2  =     3. Make 3 our new value, move our pencil to the left of the     0, and go back to step 1. \n9. (Step 1) Compute 3 mod 2. Since 3 is odd, this is one, which     we write down: \n180 CHAPTER 7. NUMBERS \n10001 \n10. (Step 2) Divide 3 by 2 and take the floor, which gives  3 / 2  =     1. This still isn't zero, so make 1 our new value, move our     pencil to the left of the 0, and go back to step 1. \n11. (Step 1) Compute 1 mod 2. Since 1 is odd, this is one, which     we write down: \n110001 \n12. (Step 2) Divide 1 by 2 and take the floor, which gives  1 / 2  =     0. We're done. The final answer is 1100012. Double-checking     our work, we verify that indeed one 32 plus one 16 plus one     1 gives 49, which is what we started with. \n**Converting to and from hex** \nThat was pretty tedious. But converting back and forth from binary to _hex_ is a snap. That's because 16 is exactly 24 , and so one hex digit is exactly equal to four binary digits. This isn't the case with base 10, where one decimal digit is equal to three binary digits... _plus_ a little extra. This \"not quite a whole number of digits\" thing is what makes converting from decimal to binary (or decimal to hex, for that matter) so awkward. \nWe most commonly deal with sets of eight bits at a time, which is called a **byte**. (This is the fundamental unit of storage on pretty much every computer on earth.) Suppose I had the following byte: \n(^100001102) Because one hex digit is exactly equal to four bits, this byte is exactly equal to: (^8616) \n7.4. BINARY (BASE 2) 181 \nThis is because the byte can be neatly split into two parts: 1000 , which corresponds to the hex digit 8, and 0110, which corresponds to the hex digit 6. These two halves are called **nibbles** -- one byte has two nibbles, and each nibble is one hex digit. At a glance, therefore, with no multiplying or adding, we can convert from binary to hex. \nGoing the other direction is just as easy. If we have: \n 3E 16 \nwe just convert each hex digit into the corresponding nibble: \n(^001111102) After you do this a while, you get to the point where you can instantly recognize which hex digit goes with which nibble value. Until then, though, here's a handy table: nibble hex digit 0000 0 0001 1 0010 2 0011 3 0100 4 0101 5 0110 6 0111 7 1000 8 1001 9 1010 A 1011 B 1100 C 1101 D 1110 E 1111 F In case you're wondering, yes this is worth memorizing. \n182 CHAPTER 7. NUMBERS \n**Adding binary numbers** \nAdding two binary numbers is the same as adding in decimal, hexadecimal, or any other base: you just have to know when to \"roll over the odometer,\" which in this case is almost instantly, since the highest value a bit can hold is 1! Let's give it a shot: \n(^1110012) + (^0110102) ? 2 A child could follow the rules: when we add two zeroes, we get zero. Adding a one to a zero gives one. Adding two ones gives zero, and a carry to the next significant digit. And adding two ones plus a carry gives a one and a carry. See if you can follow the flow: 1 1 (^1110012) + (^0110102) 1 010011 2 **Capacity** How large a value can a byte store? There are 8 bits, and each one can independently have either of two values (0 or 1), so by the Fundamental Theorem of Counting, there are 28 different combinations. This works out to 256, but we can't actually store the number 256 in a byte if we're using the bit pattern 000000002 (or 0016 ) to represent zero. The highest value would be 111111112 (or FF 16 ), which is 25610. How do we store a number larger than that? Simply use more than one byte, of course. If we used two bytes of memory, and treated them as concatenated one after the other, that would give us 16 bits, allowing us to store up to the number 00000000000000002 = FFFF 16 = 65,535 10. We'd call one of these bytes -- the one representing the 20 's place up to the 27 's place -- the least significant _byte_ , and the other one -- containing places 28 through 215 -- the most significant byte. Extending to more than two bytes to accommodate even larger numbers is done in the obvious way. \n7.4. BINARY (BASE 2) 183 \n**Binary representation schemes** \nThat's mostly all there is to it. But there's one thing we haven't discussed yet, and that's _negative_ numbers. We know how to represent any positive number (or zero) with an ordinary place value scheme.

Academic books generally fall into three categories: (1) textbooks written with students in mind, (2) monographs (books) that give an extended report on a large research project, and (3) edited volumes in which each chapter is authored by different people. Scholarly articles appear in academic journals, which are published multiple times a year in order to share the latest research findings with scholars in the field. They're usually sponsored by some academic society. To get published, these articles and books had to earn favorable anonymous evaluations by qualified scholars. Who are the experts writing, reviewing, and editing these scholarly publications? Your professors. Learning how to read and use these sources is a fundamental part of being a college student. Some events and trends are too recent to appear in Tier 1 sources. Also, Tier 1 sources tend to be highly specific, and sometimes you need a more general perspective on a topic. Thus, Tier 2 sources can provide quality information that is more accessible to nonacademics. There are three main categories: \n**1.** These are official reports from government agencies or major international     institutions like the World Bank or the United Nations; these institutions     generally have research departments staffed with qualified experts who seek     to provide rigorous, even-handed information to decision-makers. \n**2.** Feature articles from major newspapers and magazines like the _New York_     _Times_ , _Wall Street Journal_ , _London Times_ , or the _Economist_ are based on original \n#### TIER 1 \n##### PEER-REVIEWED ACADEMIC PUBLICATIONS \n#### TIER 2 \n##### REPORTS, ARTICLES, AND BOOKS FROM CREDIBLE NONACADEMIC SOURCES \n 155 COLLECTED WORKS \n reporting by experienced journalists (not press releases) and are typically fifteen hundred-plus words in length. \n**3.** There are some great books from nonacademic presses that cite their sources;     they're often written by journalists. All three of these sources are generally well-researched descriptions of an event or state of the world, undertaken by credentialed experts who generally seek to be evenhanded. It is still up to you to judge their credibility. Your instructors and campus librarians can advise you on which sources in this category have the most credibility. A step below the well-developed reports and feature articles that make up Tier 2 are the short tidbits that one finds in newspapers and magazines or credible websites. How short is a short news article? Usually, they're just a couple paragraphs or less, and they're often reporting on just one thing: an event, an interesting research finding, or a policy change. They don't take extensive research and analysis to write, and many just summarize a press release written and distributed by an organization or business. They may describe things like corporate mergers, newly discovered diet-health links, or important school-funding legislation. You may want to cite Tier 3 sources in your paper if they provide an important factoid or two that isn't provided by a higher-tier piece, but if the Tier 3 article describes a particular study or academic expert, your best bet is to find the journal article or book it is reporting on and use that Tier 1 source instead. The original sources are usually linked; if not, you can find the original journal article by putting the scholar's name and some keywords into Google Scholar or your library website. What counts as a credible website in this tier? You may need some guidance from instructors or librarians, but you can learn a lot by examining the person or organization providing the information (look for an \"About\" link). For example, if the organization is clearly agenda driven or not up-front about its aims and/or funding sources, then it definitely isn't something you want to cite as a neutral authority. Also look for signs of expertise. A tidbit about a medical research finding written by someone with a science background carries more weight than the same topic written by a policy analyst. These sources are sometimes uncertain, which is all the more reason to follow the trail to a Tier 1 or Tier 2 source whenever possible. This tier is essentially everything else, including Wikipedia. These types of sources--especially Wikipedia--can be hugely helpful in identifying interesting topics, positions within a debate, keywords to search, and, sometimes, higher-tier sources on the topic. They often play a critically important role in the early part of the research process, but they generally aren't (and \n#### TIER 3 \n##### SHORT PIECES FROM PERIODICALS OR CREDIBLE WEBSITES \n#### TIER 4 \n##### AGENDA DRIVEN OR PIECES FROM UNKNOWN SOURCES \n A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 156 \n shouldn't be) cited in the final paper. Throwing some keywords into Google and seeing what you get is a fine way to get started, but don't stop there. Start a list of the people, organizations, sources, and keywords that seem most relevant to your topic. For example, suppose you've been assigned a research paper about the impact of linen production and trade on the ancient world. A quick Google search reveals that (1) linen comes from the flax plant, (2) the scientific name for flax is Linum usitatissimum , (3) Egypt dominated linen production at the height of its empire, and (4) Alex J. Warden published a book about ancient linen trade in 1867. Similarly, you found some useful search terms to try instead of \"ancient world\" (antiquity, Egyptian empire, ancient Egypt, ancient Mediterranean) and some generalizations for linen (fabric, textiles, or weaving). Now you've got a lot to work with as you tap into the library catalog and academic article databases. Most of the Tier 1 sources available are academic articles, also called scholarly articles, scholarly papers, journal articles, academic papers, or peer-reviewed articles. They all mean the same thing: a paper published in an academic periodical after being scrutinized anonymously and judged to be sound by other experts in the subfield. Their origin explains both their basic structure and the high esteem they have in the eyes of your professors. Many journals are sponsored by academic associations. Most academics belong to a big, general one (such as the Modern Language Association, the American Psychological Association, the National Association for Sport and Physical Education, or the American Physical Society) and one or more smaller ones organized around particular areas of interest and expertise (such as the Association for the Study of Food and Society, the International Association for Statistical Computing, or the Slavic and East European Folklore Association). There are also generalist organizations organized by region of the country or state, such as the Eastern Sociological Society or the Southern Management Association. Each of these associations exists to promote the exchange of research findings and collaboration in their disciplines. Toward this end, they organize conferences, sponsor working groups, and publish one or more academic journals. These journals are meant to both publicize and archive the most interesting and important findings in the field. Academic papers are essentially reports that scholars write to their peers--present and future--about what they've done in their research, what they've found, and why they think it's important. Thus, in a lot of fields, they often have a structure reminiscent of the lab reports you've written for science classes: \n**1.** _Abstract:_ A one-paragraph summary of the article: its purpose, methods,     findings, and significance. \n**2.** _Introduction:_ An overview of the key question or problem that the paper     addresses, why it is important, and the key conclusion(s) (i.e., thesis or theses)     of the paper. \n**3.** _Literature review:_ A synthesis of all the relevant prior research (the so-called     academic literature on the subject) that explains why the paper makes an     original and important contribution to the body of knowledge. \n#### ORIGINS AND ANATOMY OF A JOURNAL ARTICLE \n 157 COLLECTED WORKS \n**4.** _Data and methods:_ An explanation of what data or information the author(s)     used and what they did with it. \n**5.** _Results:_ A full explanation of the key findings of the study. \n**6.** _Conclusion/discussion:_ Puts the key findings or insights from the paper into     their broader context; explains why they matter. Not all papers are so \"science.\" For example, a historical or literary analysis doesn't necessarily have a \"data and methods\" section, but it does explain and justify the research question, describe how the authors' own points relate to those made in other relevant articles and books, develop the key insights yielded by the analysis, and conclude by explaining their significance. Some academic papers are review articles in which the \"data\" are published papers and the \"findings\" are key insights, enduring lines of debate, and/or remaining unanswered questions. Scholarly journals use a peer-review process to decide which articles merit publication. First, hopeful authors send their article manuscript to the journal editor, a role filled by a prominent scholar in the field. The editor reads over the manuscript and decides whether it seems worthy of peer review. If it's outside the interests of the journal or is clearly inadequate, the editor will reject it outright. If it looks appropriate and sufficiently high quality, the editor will recruit a few other experts in the field to act as anonymous peer reviewers. The editor will send the manuscript (scrubbed of identifying information) to the reviewers who will read it closely and provide a thorough critique.  Is the research question driving the paper timely and important?  Does the paper sufficiently and accurately review all of the relevant prior research?  Are the information sources believable and the research methods rigorous?  Are the stated results fully justified by the findings?  Is the significance of the research clear?  Is it well written?  Overall, does the paper add new, trustworthy, and important knowledge to the field? Reviewers send their comments to the editor, who then decides whether to (1) reject the manuscript, (2) ask the author(s) to revise and resubmit the manuscript, or (3) accept it for publication. Editors send the reviewers' comments (again, with no identifying information) to authors along with their decisions. A manuscript that has been revised and resubmitted usually goes out for peer review again; editors often try to get reviews from one or two first-round reviewers as well as a new reviewer. The whole process, from start to finish, can easily take a year, and it is often another year before the paper appears in print. Understanding the academic publication process and the structure of scholarly articles tells you a lot about how to find, read, and use these sources: A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 158 \n Instead of paging through mountains of dubious web content, go right to the relevant scholarly article databases in order to quickly find the highest-quality sources. Abstracts tell you immediately whether the article you're holding is relevant or useful to the paper you're assigned to write. You shouldn't ever have the experience of reading the whole paper just to discover it's not useful. Knowing the anatomy of a scholarly article tells you what you should be reading for in each section. For example, you don't necessarily need to understand every nuance of the literature review. You can just focus on why the authors claim that their own study is distinct from the ones that came before. Not every social scientist understands the intricacies of log-linear modeling of quantitative survey data; however, the reviewers definitely do, and they found the analysis to be well constructed. Thus, you can accept the findings as legitimate and just focus on the passages that explain the findings and their significance in plainer language. If you have a really good article that's a few years old, you can use article databases to find newer articles that cited it in their own literature reviews. That immediately tells you which ones are on the same topic and offer newer findings. On the other hand, if your first source is recent, the literature review section will describe the other papers in the same line of research. You can look them up directly. Students sometimes grumble when they're ordered to use scholarly articles in their research. It seems a lot easier to just Google some terms and find stuff that way. However, academic articles are the most efficient resource out there. They are vetted by experts and structured specifically to help readers zero in on the most important passages. Your campus library pays big money to subscribe to databases for Tier 1 articles. Some are general purpose databases that include the most prominent journals across disciplines, and some are specific to a particular discipline. Often they have the full text of the articles right there for you to save or print. We won't go over particular databases here because every campus has different offerings.

It would break the standpoint rule to argue that the writer/ speaker does not believe in global warming. This is not the issue at hand. Similar to #3, this rule assures that the evidence you use must actually relate to your standpoint. Let's stick with the same argument: global warming has created a green industry benefiting from fears over climate change. Under this rule, your evidence would need to offer examples of the rhetoric and the resulting businesses that have developed since the introduction of green industries. It would break the rules to simply offer attacks on businesses that sell \"eco-friendly\" products. This one sounds a bit complex, though it happens nearly every day. If you have been talking to another person and feel the need to say, \"That's not what I meant,\" then you have experienced a violation of the unexpressed premise rule. Overall, the rule attempts to keep the argument on track and not let it stray into irrelevant territory. The first violation of the rule, to falsely present what has been left unexpressed, is to rephrase someone's standpoint in a way that redirects the argument. One person might argue, \"I love to go to the beach,\" and another might respond by saying, \"So you don't have any appreciation for mountain living.\" The other aspect of this rule is to camouflage an unpopular idea and deny that it is part of your argument. For example, you might argue, \"I have nothing against my neighbors. I just think that there should be a noise ordinance in this part of town to help cut down on crime.\" This clearly shows that the writer does believe her neighbors to be criminals but won't admit it. \n#### IV. THE RELEVANCE RULE \n A PARTY MAY DEFEND HIS OR HER STANDPOINT ONLY BY ADVANCING ARGUMENTATION RELATED TO THAT STANDPOINT. \n# \" \n (van Eemeren et al. 119) \n#### V. THE UNEXPRESSED PREMISE RULE \n A PARTY MAY NOT FALSELY PRESENT SOMETHING AS A PREMISE THAT HAS BEEN LEFT UNEXPRESSED BY THE OTHER PARTY OR DENY A PREMISE THAT HE OR SHE HAS LEFT IMPLICIT. \n# \" \n (van Eemeren et al. 121) 87 COLLECTED WORKS \n Part of quality argumentation is to agree on the opening standpoint. According to this theory, argument is pointless without this kind of agreement. It is well known that arguing about abortion is nearly pointless as long as one side is arguing about the rights of the unborn and the other about the rights of women. These are two different starting points. This rule is about argument strategy. Argument schemes could take up another paper altogether. Suffice it to say that schemes are ways of approaching an argument, your primary strategy. For example, you might choose emotional rather than logical appeals to present your position. This rule highlights the fact that some argument strategies are simply better than others. For example, if you choose to create an argument based largely on attacking the character of your opponent rather than the issues at hand, the argument is moot. Argument by analogy is a popular and well-worn argument strategy (or scheme). Essentially, you compare your position to a more commonly known one and make your argument through the comparison. For example, in the \"Trust No One\" argument in chapter 9, the author equates the Watergate and Monica Lewinsky scandals. Since it is common knowledge that Watergate was a serious scandal, including Monica Lewinsky in the list offers a strong argument by analogy: the Lewinsky scandal did as much damage as Watergate. To break this rule, you might make an analogy that does not hold up, such as comparing a minor scandal involving a local school board to Watergate. This would be an exaggeration, in most cases. \n#### VI. THE STARTING POINT RULE \n NO PARTY MAY FALSELY PRESENT A PREMISE AS AN ACCEPTED STARTING POINT, OR DENY A PREMISE REPRESENTING AN ACCEPTED STARTING POINT. \n# \" \n (van Eemeren et al. 128) \n#### VII. THE ARGUMENT SCHEME RULE \n A STANDPOINT MAY NOT BE REGARDED AS CONCLUSIVELY DEFENDED IF THE DEFENSE DOES NOT TAKE PLACE BY MEANS OF AN APPROPRIATE ARGUMENT SCHEME THAT IS CORRECTLY APPLIED. \n# \" \n (van Eemeren et al. 130) A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 88 \n This rule is about traditional logics. Violating this rule means that the parts of your argument do not match up. For example, your cause and effect might be off: If you swim in the ocean today, you will get stung by a jellyfish and need medical care. Joe went to the doctor today. He must have been stung by a jellyfish. While this example is obvious (we do not know that Joe went swimming), many argument problems are caused by violating this rule. This seems the most obvious rule, yet it is one that most public arguments ignore. If your argument does not cut it, admit the faults and move on. If another writer/speaker offers a rebuttal and you clearly counter it, admit that the original argument is sound. Seems simple, but it's not in our public culture. This would mean that George W. Bush would have to have a press conference and say, \"My apologies, I was wrong about WMD,\" or for someone who argued fervently that Americans want a single-payer option for health care to instead argue something like, \"The polls show that Americans want to change health care, but not through the singlepayer option. My argument was based on my opinion that the single-payer option is the best way and not on public opinion.\" Academics are more accustomed to retraction because our arguments are explicitly part of particular conversations. Rebuttals and renegotiations are the norm. That does not make them any easier to stomach in an \"argument is war\" culture. \n#### VIII. THE VALIDITY RULE \n THE REASONING IN THE ARGUMENTATION MUST BE LOGICALLY VALID OR MUST BE CAPABLE OF BEING MADE VALID BY MAKING EXPLICIT ONE OR MORE UNEXPRESSED PREMISES. \n# \" \n (van Eemeren et al. 132) \n#### IX. THE CLOSURE RULE \n A FAILED DEFENSE OF A STANDPOINT MUST RESULT IN THE PROTAGONIST RETRACTING THE STANDPOINT, AND A SUCCESSFUL DEFENSE OF A STANDPOINT MUST RESULT IN THE ANTAGONIST RETRACTING HIS OR HER DOUBTS. \n# \" \n (van Eemeren et al. 134) 89 COLLECTED WORKS \n While academics are perhaps the worst violators of this rule, it is an important one to discuss. Be clear. I notice in both student and professional academic writing that a confusing concept often means confusing prose, longer sentences, and more letters in a word. If you cannot say it / write it clearly, the concept might not yet be clear to you. Keep working. Ethical violations of this rule happen when someone is purposefully ambiguous so as to confuse the issue. We can see this on all the \"law\" shows on television or through deliberate propaganda.

What's the problem with violating     these rules? \n**2.** Why is it helpful to identify and learn names for these rules? How does it     impact how you may see arguments in the future? \n**3.** Is it possible to win the debate but still \"lose\" by some other measure? How     do the ethics of argumentation connect to this question? \n#### X.

Discuss     what they did and how it impacted their argument. \n**2.** Find a print ad or short commercial on the internet that violates one of     these rules. How so? Why do they do this? Is it effective? Is it manipulative? \n**3.** Choose one of the \"rules\" that are established in this chapter:      Write a short argument (one to two sentences) about your        next paper topic that clearly violates the rule. This can be a        poorly framed version of your own argument, or it could        be a real (but fallacious) argument that other people make        about the issue.      Explain why this argument violates the rule. Why might        someone do this in an argument? Would it be effective? (To        be clear, these fallacies are examples of what not to        do--but, of course, people still use them.)

They struggle to let go of certain assumptions about how an academic paper should be. Some students who have mastered that form, and enjoyed a lot of success from doing so, assume that college writing is simply more of the same. The skills that go into a very basic kind of essay--often called the five-paragraph theme--are indispensable. If you're good at the five-paragraph theme, then you're good at identifying a clearfl and consistent thesis, arranging cohesive paragraphs, organizing evidence for key points, and situating an argument within a broader context through the intro and conclusion. In college you need to build on those essential skills. The five-paragraph theme, as such, is bland and formulaic; it doesn't compel deep thinking. Your instructors are looking for a more ambitious and arguable thesis, a nuanced and compelling argument, and real-life evidence for all key points, all in an organically structured paper. Figures 12.1 and 12.2 contrast the standard five-paragraph theme and the organic college paper. The five-paragraph theme (outlined in figure 12.1) is probably what you're used to: the introductory paragraph starts broad and gradually narrows to a thesis, which readers expect to find at the very end of that paragraph. In this idealized format, the thesis invokes the magic number of three: three reasons why a statement is true. Each of those reasons is explained and justified in the three body paragraphs, and then the final paragraph restates the thesis before gradually getting broader. This format is easy for readers to follow, and it helps writers organize their points and the evidence that goes with them. That's why you learned this format. \n#### MOVING BEYOND THE FIVE-PARAGRAPH THEME \n A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 92 \n_Fig 12.1 The five-paragraph \"theme\"_ In contrast, figure 12.2 represents a paper on the same topic that has the more organic form expected in college. The first key difference is the thesis. Rather than simply positing a number of reasons to think that something is true, it puts forward an arguable statement: one with which a reasonable person might disagree. An arguable thesis gives the paper purpose. It surprises readers and draws them in. You hope your reader thinks, \"Huh. Why would they come to that conclusion?\" and then feels compelled to read on. The body paragraphs, then, build on one another to carry out this ambitious argument. In the classic five-paragraph theme (figure 12.1), it hardly matters which of the three reasons you explain first or second. In the more organic structure (figure 12.2), each paragraph specifically leads to the next. The last key difference is seen in the conclusion. Because the organic essay is driven by an ambitious, nonobvious argument, the reader comes to the concluding section thinking, \"OK, I'm convinced by the argument. What do you, author, make of it? Why does it matter?\" The conclusion of an organically structured paper has a real job to do. It doesn't just reiterate the thesis; it explains why the thesis matters. 93 COLLECTED WORKS \n Fig 12.2 The organic college paper The substantial time you spent mastering the five-paragraph form in figure 12.1 was time well spent; it's hard to imagine anyone succeeding with the more organic form without the organizational skills and habits of mind inherent in the simpler form. (And it is worth noting that there are limited moments in college where the five-paragraph structure is still useful--inclass essay exams, for example.) But if you assume that you must adhere rigidly to the simpler form, you're blunting your intellectual ambition. Your instructors will not be impressed by obvious theses, loosely related body paragraphs, and repetitive conclusions. They want you to undertake an ambitious independent analysis, one that will yield a thesis that is somewhat surprising and challenging to explain.

(Step 1) Now compute 1838 mod 16. This gives us the value     14, which is of course a base 10 number. The equivalent hex     digit is E. So we now write down E to the left of the 3: \nE3 \n4. (Step 2) Dividing 1838 by 16 and taking the floor gives us \n114. Since this is again not zero, we perform step 2b: make 114 our new value, move our pencil to the left of the E, and go back to step 1. \n5. (Step 1) Next we compute 114 mod 16. This turns out to be     2, so we write down a 2: \n2E3 \n176 CHAPTER 7. NUMBERS \n6. (Step 2) Computing  114 / 16  produces 7, which is again not     zero, so 7 becomes our new value and we go back once again     to step 2b. \n7. (Step 1) 7 mod 16 is simply 7, so we write it down: \n72E3 \n8. (Step 2) Finally,  7 / 16  is zero, so we go to step 2a and     we're done. The page has 72E3 written on it in big bold     letters, which is the correct answer. \n**Adding hex numbers** \nSuppose we have two hexadecimal numbers, and we want to add them together to get a hexadecimal result. How do we do it? One way is to first convert them both to decimal, then add them like you learned in first grade, then convert the answer back to hex. But we can stay \"natively hex\" as long as we add each pair of digits correctly. \nLet's try it. Suppose we want to compute this sum: \n48 D (^416) +59 2 5 16 ? 16 We proceed in the first-grade way from right to left. Adding the one's-place values, we get 4 + 5 = 9: 48 D (^416) +59 2 5 16 (^916) Easy enough. Now we add the next digit to the left (the sixteen'splace, mind you, not the ten's place) and we find D + 2. Now what in the world is \"D+2\"? It's actually easy: all you have to do is the same thing you did when you were a child and you had to add something like 4 + 5. You hadn't memorized the answer \n7.4. BINARY (BASE 2) 177 \nyet, and so you started with four fingers held up, and counted off \"1... 2... 3... 4... 5,\" sticking up another finger each time. Then, you looked at your hands, and behold! nine fingers. \nWe'll do the same thing here: start with the number \"D,\" and count two additional places: \"E... F.\" The answer is F. That is the number that's two greater than D. Lucky for us, it still fits in one digit. So now we have: \n48 D (^416) +59 2 5 16 F (^916) So far so good. The next pair of digits is 8 + 9. Here's where you want to be careful. You're liable to look at \"8+9\" and immediately say \"17!\" But 8 + 9 is _not_ 17 in hexadecimal. To figure out what it is, we start with the number 8, and count: \"9... A... B... C... D... E... F... 10... 11... \". The answer is \"11,\" which of course is how you write \"seventeen\" in hex. So just like in grade school, we write down 1 and carry the 1: 1 48 D (^416) +59 2 5 16 1 F (^916) Finally, our last digit is 4 + 5, plus the carried 1. We start with four and count off five: \"5... 6... 7... 8... 9.\" Then we add the carry, and count \"... A.\" The answer is A, with no carry, and so we have our final answer: 1 4 8D (^416) + 5 9 2 5 16 **A1F9 16 7.4 Binary (base 2)** The other base we commonly use in computer science is base 2, or **binary**. This is because the basic unit of information in a computer is called a **bit** , which has only two values, conventionally called either \"true\" and \"false\" or \"1\" and \"0\". Numbers (as well \n178 CHAPTER 7. NUMBERS \nas everything else) are ultimately represented as colossal sequences of 1's and 0's, which are of course binary numbers. \nThe rules for interpreting place value are the same: \n 1101012 = 1 x 25 + 1 x 24 + 0 x 23 + 1 x 22 + 0 x 21 + 1 x 20 = 1 x 32 + 1 x 16 + 0 x 8 + 1 x 4 + 0 x 2 + 1 x 1 = 5310. \nSo in binary we have a one's-place, a two's-place, a four's-place, an eight's-place, and so on. We call the right-most place the **least significant bit (LSB)** and the left-most the **most significant bit (MSB)**. \nCounting up from zero is really just the same as any other base, although it feels a little strange in binary because you \"roll over\" so often: \n 02 zero 12 one 102 two 112 three 1002 four 1012 five 1102 six 1112 seven 10002 eight 10012 nine .. . \n .. . \n**Converting to and from decimal** \nConverting from binary to decimal was demonstrated above (with 1101012 = 53 10 .) To go the other way, we follow the algorithm from page 174. Let's try it for the decimal number 49: \n1. (Step 1) We first compute 49 mod 2. Doing \"mod 2\" is easy:     you just see whether the number is even or odd. In this case,     it's odd, so the remainder is a 1: \n7.4. BINARY (BASE 2) 179 \n1 \n2. (Step 2) Now divide 49 by 2 and take the floor, which gives      49 / 2  = 24. It's not zero, so we perform step 2b: make 24     our new value, move our pencil to the left of the 1, and go     back to step 1. \n3. (Step 1) Compute 24 mod 2. Since 24 is even, this is zero,     which we write down to the left of the 1: \n01 \n4. (Step 2) Divide 24 by 2 and take the floor, which gives  24 /     2  = 12. Make 12 our new value, move our pencil to the left     of the 0, and go back to step 1. \n5. (Step 1) Compute 12 mod 2. Since 12 is even, this is zero,     which we write down: \n001 \n6. (Step 2) Divide 12 by 2 and take the floor, which gives  12 /     2  = 6. Make 6 our new value, move our pencil to the left of     the 0, and go back to step 1. \n7. (Step 1) Compute 6 mod 2. Since 6 is even, this is zero, which     we write down: \n0001 \n8. (Step 2) Divide 6 by 2 and take the floor, which gives  6 / 2  =     3. Make 3 our new value, move our pencil to the left of the     0, and go back to step 1. \n9. (Step 1) Compute 3 mod 2. Since 3 is odd, this is one, which     we write down: \n180 CHAPTER 7. NUMBERS \n10001 \n10. (Step 2) Divide 3 by 2 and take the floor, which gives  3 / 2  =     1. This still isn't zero, so make 1 our new value, move our     pencil to the left of the 0, and go back to step 1. \n11. (Step 1) Compute 1 mod 2. Since 1 is odd, this is one, which     we write down: \n110001 \n12. (Step 2) Divide 1 by 2 and take the floor, which gives  1 / 2  =     0. We're done. The final answer is 1100012. Double-checking     our work, we verify that indeed one 32 plus one 16 plus one     1 gives 49, which is what we started with. \n**Converting to and from hex** \nThat was pretty tedious. But converting back and forth from binary to _hex_ is a snap. That's because 16 is exactly 24 , and so one hex digit is exactly equal to four binary digits. This isn't the case with base 10, where one decimal digit is equal to three binary digits... _plus_ a little extra. This \"not quite a whole number of digits\" thing is what makes converting from decimal to binary (or decimal to hex, for that matter) so awkward. \nWe most commonly deal with sets of eight bits at a time, which is called a **byte**. (This is the fundamental unit of storage on pretty much every computer on earth.) Suppose I had the following byte: \n(^100001102) Because one hex digit is exactly equal to four bits, this byte is exactly equal to: (^8616) \n7.4. BINARY (BASE 2) 181 \nThis is because the byte can be neatly split into two parts: 1000 , which corresponds to the hex digit 8, and 0110, which corresponds to the hex digit 6. These two halves are called **nibbles** -- one byte has two nibbles, and each nibble is one hex digit. At a glance, therefore, with no multiplying or adding, we can convert from binary to hex. \nGoing the other direction is just as easy. If we have: \n 3E 16 \nwe just convert each hex digit into the corresponding nibble: \n(^001111102) After you do this a while, you get to the point where you can instantly recognize which hex digit goes with which nibble value. Until then, though, here's a handy table: nibble hex digit 0000 0 0001 1 0010 2 0011 3 0100 4 0101 5 0110 6 0111 7 1000 8 1001 9 1010 A 1011 B 1100 C 1101 D 1110 E 1111 F In case you're wondering, yes this is worth memorizing. \n182 CHAPTER 7. NUMBERS \n**Adding binary numbers** \nAdding two binary numbers is the same as adding in decimal, hexadecimal, or any other base: you just have to know when to \"roll over the odometer,\" which in this case is almost instantly, since the highest value a bit can hold is 1! Let's give it a shot: \n(^1110012) + (^0110102) ? 2 A child could follow the rules: when we add two zeroes, we get zero. Adding a one to a zero gives one. Adding two ones gives zero, and a carry to the next significant digit. And adding two ones plus a carry gives a one and a carry. See if you can follow the flow: 1 1 (^1110012) + (^0110102) 1 010011 2 **Capacity** How large a value can a byte store? There are 8 bits, and each one can independently have either of two values (0 or 1), so by the Fundamental Theorem of Counting, there are 28 different combinations. This works out to 256, but we can't actually store the number 256 in a byte if we're using the bit pattern 000000002 (or 0016 ) to represent zero. The highest value would be 111111112 (or FF 16 ), which is 25610. How do we store a number larger than that? Simply use more than one byte, of course. If we used two bytes of memory, and treated them as concatenated one after the other, that would give us 16 bits, allowing us to store up to the number 00000000000000002 = FFFF 16 = 65,535 10. We'd call one of these bytes -- the one representing the 20 's place up to the 27 's place -- the least significant _byte_ , and the other one -- containing places 28 through 215 -- the most significant byte. Extending to more than two bytes to accommodate even larger numbers is done in the obvious way. \n7.4. BINARY (BASE 2) 183 \n**Binary representation schemes** \nThat's mostly all there is to it. But there's one thing we haven't discussed yet, and that's _negative_ numbers. We know how to represent any positive number (or zero) with an ordinary place value scheme.

A system in the variables x 1 , x 2 , x 3 would behave the same if we changed the names of the variables to a, b, c and kept all the constants the same and in the same places. In this section, we will isolate the key bits of information about a system of equations into something called a matrix, and then use this matrix to systematically solve the equations. Along the way we will obtain one of our most important and useful computational tools. \n##### Subsection MVNSE \n##### Matrix and Vector Notation for Systems of Equations \nDefinition M Matrix An m x n matrix is a rectangular layout of numbers from C having m rows and n columns. We will use upper-case Latin letters from the start of the alphabet (A, B, C,... ) to denote matrices and squared-off brackets to delimit the layout. Many use large parentheses instead of brackets -- the distinction is not important. Rows of a matrix will be referenced starting at the top and working down (i.e. row 1 is at the top) and columns will be referenced starting from the left (i.e. column 1 is at the left). For a matrix A, the notation [A]ij will refer to the complex number in row i and column j of A. \u0003 Be careful with this notation for individual entries, since it is easy to think that [A]ij refers to the whole matrix. It does not. It is just a number, but is a convenient way to talk about the individual entries simultaneously. This notation will get a heavy workout once we get to Chapter M. Example AM A matrix \n B = \n [- 1 2 5 3 1 0 - 6 1 - 4 2 2 - 2 \n ] \n is a matrix with m = 3 rows and n = 4 columns. We can say that [B] 2 , 3 = -6 while [B] 3 , 4 = -2. 4 When we do equation operations on system of equations, the names of the variables really are not very important. Use x 1 , x 2 , x 3 , or a, b, c, or x, y, z, it really does not matter. In this subsection we will describe some notation that will make it easier to describe linear systems, solve the systems and describe the solution sets. Here is a list of definitions, laden with notation. Definition CV Column Vector A column vector of size m is an ordered list of m numbers, which is written in order vertically, starting at the top and proceeding to the bottom. At times, we will refer to a column vector as simply a vector. Column vectors will be written in bold, usually with lower case Latin letter from the end of the alphabet such as u, v, w, x, y, z. Some books like to write vectors with arrows, such as ~u. Writing by hand, some like to put arrows on top of the symbol, or a tilde underneath the symbol, as in u ~ \n.

This works out to 256, but we can't actually store the number 256 in a byte if we're using the bit pattern 000000002 (or 0016 ) to represent zero. The highest value would be 111111112 (or FF 16 ), which is 25610. How do we store a number larger than that? Simply use more than one byte, of course. If we used two bytes of memory, and treated them as concatenated one after the other, that would give us 16 bits, allowing us to store up to the number 00000000000000002 = FFFF 16 = 65,535 10. We'd call one of these bytes -- the one representing the 20 's place up to the 27 's place -- the least significant _byte_ , and the other one -- containing places 28 through 215 -- the most significant byte. Extending to more than two bytes to accommodate even larger numbers is done in the obvious way. \n7.4. BINARY (BASE 2) 183 \n**Binary representation schemes** \nThat's mostly all there is to it. But there's one thing we haven't discussed yet, and that's _negative_ numbers. We know how to represent any positive number (or zero) with an ordinary place value scheme. But how do we store a number like - 5? \nThere are three different schemes for treating negative numbers, each with its strengths and weaknesses. \n**Unsigned** \nThe simplest scheme is called **unsigned** , and it simply means that we don't _allow_ negative numbers. For one byte, we have 256 different bit patterns at our disposal, and we might just choose to allocate them all to represent positive numbers, so as to get the widest range. This makes sense for, say, a C++ program variable called heightInInches which we know can never meaningfully be negative (no one has a negative height). \nThe advantage of this scheme is simply that we can represent the greatest possible range of positive numbers, which is sometimes the goal. Each of the alternative schemes carves off a chunk of these available bit patterns and devotes them to representing negative numbers, leaving fewer left over for positive numbers. There's no free lunch: you have to decide how you want to \"spend\" your available bit patterns depending on what values you need to represent. \n**Sign-magnitude** \nThe **sign-magnitude** scheme is probably the first thing you'd think of to solve the negative number representation problem. We need to store the sign of the number somehow, and a sign is inherently a two-valued thing (either positive or negative), so why not peel off one of the bits and use it to represent the sign? The remaining bits can then be used in the ordinary way to represent the magnitude of the number. \nThe way this is most often done is to take the left-most bit and use it as the **sign bit**. This bit now has _no other meaning_. It \n184 CHAPTER 7. NUMBERS \ncan't \"double\" as the 128's place, because then there'd be no way to distinguish between, say, 129 and - 129 (each would be represented with 10000001 .) No, the sign bit must be considered \"spent money,\" and its expressive power cannot be reclaimed to also represent part of the magnitude. By convention, if the sign bit is 0 this represents a _positive_ number, and a sign bit of 1 represents a _negative_ number. (That might seem counterintuitive, but hey, that's the way it is.) \nSo this number in sign-magnitude: \n 0 0100110 \nrepresents the decimal number 38. That's because the sign bit (bolded, on the far left) is 0, which means the number is positive. The magnitude of the number is contained in the other 7 bits, which gives 32 + 4 + 2 = 38. This number, on the other hand: \n 1 0100110 \nrepresents - 38. The magnitude is the same, but the sign bit is 1 so this pattern now \"means\" a negative number. \nClearly we have reduced our range of positive numbers in exchange for the ability to also store negatives. We have 7 bits of range instead of 8, so instead of 255, our highest possible value is merely \n127. On the other end, the lowest possible value is - 127. \nIf you have sharp eyes, you may have noticed a discrepancy in the counting. With the sign-magnitude approach, we can hold numbers in the range - 127 to 127. But wait: that's only 255 different values, not 256! Why did we lose one value of expressive power? The answer is that the sign-magnitude scheme has _two ways_ of representing _zero_. The bit pattern 00000000 is obviously zero, but so is 10000000 (which you might call \"negative zero.\") Using two different patterns to represent the same value is a little wasteful, but the situation is actually worse than that. Having to account for both patterns means that computer hardware using the signmagnitude scheme is inevitably more complicated. To compare two \n7.4. BINARY (BASE 2) 185 \nbytes to see if they're equal, you'd think we'd just compare each bit position, and if they were all the same, the bytes would be declared equal, otherwise no. Alas, this is no longer quite that simple. The two zero patterns must be considered numerically equal, so our digital logic now has to contain a special case. \"To be equal, all the bits have to be the same... oh, but actually not if the right-most seven are all zeroes in both bytes. In that case, it doesn't matter what the left-most bit contains.\" Maddening. \n**Two's-complement** \nThis shortcoming in the sign-magnitude scheme is remedied with the **two's-complement** scheme, which is the one actually used most often in practice. It'll seem weird at first -- certainly not as intuitive as the first two -- but it leads to a critically important feature that we'll look at shortly. \nFirst, the rules. To interpret a two's-complement number, you: \n1. Look at the left-most bit (just like in sign-magnitude). If     it's a 0, you have a positive number. If it's a 1, you have a     negative number. \n2. If it's a positive number, the other 7 bits give you the mag-     nitude (just like in sign-magnitude). \n3. If, however, it's a negative number, then to discover the mag-     nitude of that negative number you must _flip all the bits and_     _add one_. This will give you a positive number which is the     absolute value of your negative number. \nEasy example: take the byte 00100110. The left-most bit is a 0, which means it's a positive number, and as we discovered above, the remaining 7 bits give a magnitude of 38. So this is the number 38. \nHarder example: take the byte 10100110. The left-most bit is a 1, which means it's negative. Okay: negative _what_? How do we find the magnitude? Well, we \"flip\" all the bits ( _i.e._ , invert each one \n186 CHAPTER 7. NUMBERS \nfrom 0 to 1 or vice versa) to get: \n 01011001 \nand then add one to the result: \n 1 01011001 + 1 01011010 \nThis black magic produces the value 010110102 , which converts to 9010. **This means that the original number, 10100110 , corresponds to the value -90.** \n\"Flipping all the bits and adding one\" is the cookbook procedure for taking the complement (negative) of a number in the two'scomplement scheme. It works in reverse, too. Let's start with 90 this time and crank through the process again, making sure we get -90. \nStart with the binary representation of 9010 : \n 01011010 \nFlip all the bits to get: 10100101 \nand finally add one to the result: \n 1 10100101 + 1 10100110 \nWe get 10100110 , which was precisely the number we originally began with, and which we have already determined represents -90. \nNow you may ask what we gain from all this. Surely this scheme is considerably more convoluted than the simple idea of reserving one bit as a sign bit, and treating the rest as a magnitude. But it turns out there is indeed a method to the madness. Strange as \n7.4. BINARY (BASE 2) 187 \nit sounds, a two's-complement representation scheme allows us to _perform addition and subtraction with a single operation._ \nIn first grade (or so), you learned the procedure for adding multidigit numbers, which we've followed several times in this chapter. It involves adding the digits right-to-left and possibly \"carrying.\" Then in second grade (or so), you learned the procedure for _subtracting_ multi-digit numbers. It involves subtracting the digits right-to-left and possibly \"borrowing.\" If you're like me, you found adding easier than subtracting. It's easy to just carry the one, but to borrow requires looking at the digit to the left, making sure that you _can_ borrow from it ( _i.e._ , that it's not already 0), borrowing from further left until you actually find an available non-zero value, hoping the number on the bottom is actually less than the one on the top (because otherwise you have to switch the order and then add a negative sign to the result), and keeping all of that straight as you march down the line. \nEven if you didn't find subtracting more difficult than adding, though, you can't argue that it's still a completely _different_ algorithm, with different rules to follow. In computer hardware, we have to implement different circuitry to perform each operation, which is more difficult, costly, error-prone, and power-draining. \nThe wonderful thing about two's-complement, however, is that with this scheme we actually _never need to use the subtraction algorithm._ If we want to subtract two numbers -- say, 24 - 37 -- we can instead take the complement of the second number and then add them. Instead of 24 - 37 we compute 24 + (-37). \nLet's see it in action. Using conversion procedures, we can figure out that 2410 is: \n 00011000 \nand that _positive_ 3710 is: \n 00100101 \nIf we wanted to compute 24 + 37, we'd just add these. But instead we're looking for 24 - 37 , so we'll take the complement of 37 to find \n188 CHAPTER 7. NUMBERS \n- 37. Flip all the bits of 37: \n 11011010 \nand add one: 1 1011010 + 1 1 1011011 \nand so now we've determined that in the two's-complement scheme, - 37 is represented by 110110112. \nWe're now ready to compute 24 + (-37): \n 1 1 \n00011000 - this is (^2410) + 11011011 - this is - (^3710) 11110011 So we have our two's-complement answer, 11110011. What value does that correspond to? Well, the left-most bit is a 1, so it's a negative number. To find out what it's the negative _of_ , flip all the bits and add one: 0 0001100 - flip the bits to get + 1 - add one 0 0001101 This is positive 13, which means the number we inverted to get it -- 11110011 -- must represent - 13. And that is indeed the correct answer, for 24 - 37 = - 13. One last word on two's-complement: what is the _range_ of numbers we can represent? It turns out to be -128 to 127. The highest value is 01111111 , which is 127. You might think the lowest value would be represented as 11111111 , but if you work it out, you'll find that this is actually the number - 1. The lowest number is actually the bit pattern 10000000 , which is - 128. **Overflow** One last sticky detail we need to cover has to do with **overflow**. When we add two numbers, there is the possibility that the result \n7.4. BINARY (BASE 2) 189 \nwill contain one more digit than the original numbers did. You've probably seen this on a hand calculator when you press \"=\" and get an \"E\" (for \"error\") in the display. If there are only ten digits on your display, adding two ten-digit numbers will (sometimes) result in an eleven-digit number that your calculator can't display, and it's alerting you to that fact so you don't misinterpret the result. Here, we might add two 8-bit quantities and end up with a 9-bit quantity that can't fit in one byte. This situation is called overflow, and we need to detect when it occurs. \nThe rules for detecting overflow are different depending on the scheme. For _unsigned_ numbers, the rule is simple: if a 1 is carried out from the MSB (far left-side), then we have overflow. So if I were to try to add 15510 and 10810 : \n 1 1 1 1 \n10011011 - (^15510) + 01101100 - (^10810) 1 00001111 then I get a carry out left into the 9th digit. Since we can only hold eight digits in our result, we would get a nonsensical </passage>"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<tool_call>\\n{\"arguments\": {\"queries\": [\"How does the two's-complement scheme allow for addition and subtraction with a single operation?\", \"Why is the sign-magnitude scheme considered less efficient than the two's-complement scheme?\", 'Can you think of any drawbacks to using the sign-magnitude scheme for representing negative numbers?'], \"name\": \"ExpertQAExtractor\"}}\\n</tool_call>"}]}

As writers, it is a powerful tool to be able to move back and forth between stylistic modes and communication styles--the better to reach our readers. The following elements of style (in alphabetical order) are just some of the areas where you can make these writerly choices. \n##### Concise Writing \n Concision is the opposite of wordiness. Concise writing is tight and bright; it is clear and content-rich. In other words, it contains no additional fluff or unnecessary words. Why is fluff a problem, at a sentence or paragraph level? Why does this matter, do you think? In the worst cases, wordiness leads to whole paragraphs of fluff and repetition. Sometimes this happens when students are asked to meet a page-length requirement for an assignment. \"How can I possibly write five to six pages about the Endangered Species Act?\" you may wonder. That's a great question and one you could work on with your instructor--but the answer should ultimately boil down to better content, not fluff paragraphs. (A few ideas: add a counterargument, bring in another source, give an example, ask a more complex question, etc.) A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 202 \nIn most writing, though, wordiness happens unconsciously. The kinds of extra words that we add in conversation can make a written sentence confusing and less impactful. Because writing is a more crafted form of communication, we can take the time to edit ourselves and remove the fluff for a stronger final product. Consider the following examples: _Wordy:_ The author of this article, Dr. Belinda Jackson, who is a psychologist and researches cognition, makes the argument that metacognition is very helpful for student learning. _Concise:_ Cognitive psychologist Dr. Belinda Jackson argues that metacognition improves student learning. Notice that the _content_ of the sentence didn't change. Concision is not about simplifying your ideas or removing important details. Instead, the goal is to remove unnecessary words that dilute or confuse the sentence. A more concise sentence is easier to understand and therefore makes a stronger impact. In fact, it leaves room for _more_ content: a concise writer can pack an incredible amount of information and ideas into a paragraph. Conciseness is an ongoing exercise for all writers. Here are a few tips to make your writing more concise:  Remove unnecessary repetition. For example, a \"slow, unhurried, leisurely stroll\" could be rewritten as simply \"a leisurely stroll.\"  Remove empty modifiers--adjectives and adverbs that don't significantly contribute to the meaning of the sentence and are used only to intensify the word they are modifying. The most common ones are _very, really, pretty, totally,_ and _just_.  Use an active voice when it makes sense to do so. More on this in the \"Passive and Active Voice\" section below.  Combine sentences to avoid repetition. For example, this version is wordy: \"I went to the store. The store was Winco. They were closed.\" A more concise version would be \"I went to Winco, but they were closed.\" Notice that concise writing does not always mean short, simple sentences. As Strunk and White put it in their famous book _The Elements of Style_ , That's a high bar but something to aspire to as you work to make your writing concise and content-rich. Vigorous writing is concise. A sentence should contain no unnecessary words, a paragraph no unnecessary sentences, for the same reason that a drawing should have no unnecessary lines and a machine no unnecessary parts. This requires not that the writer make all his sentences short, or that he avoid all detail and treat his subjects only in outline, but that every word tell. (46) 203 COLLECTED WORKS \n##### Correctness \n Many writers feel concerned about \"grammar\" (I used quote marks here because often what they really mean is clarity, syntax, punctuation, or even spelling--any kind of English usage or mechanics). Often, these writers have been told that their writing contains errors or that it's difficult to understand. This can happen for many reasons. Knowledge of mechanics and English usage comes from a combination of the language or dialect you spoke growing up, the way you process language, your exposure to written language, and more. This anxiety can be exacerbated by encounters with \"grammar Nazis\"--people who take it upon themselves to get out their (literal or figurative) red pen and tell you (and the world) exactly what you've done wrong. You may have a grammar stickler in your own life, and the internet is certainly full of them. We've all seen the correction *you're as a saucy retort to haters in the comments section (one of the most satisfying and, it has to be said, pedantic responses out there). The internet itself--and all digital communication--is a great example of how language and English usage are constantly in flux. How often do you see a period at the end of a text message--and if you do, what did you do to make the writer angry? How long has the phrase \"because internet\" been considered a complete thought? Internet linguistics is fascinating in its own right, but I bring it up here as an example of a larger point: grammar is made up. Yes, there are some stylistic and usage choices that make our meaning clearer and more graceful, but some rules are arbitrary and were invented by eighteenthand nineteenth-century grammarians. (\"Never end a sentence with a preposition,\" I'm looking at you--an arbitrary rule if I ever heard one.) There is something to be said for correctness. Errors can distract readers from ideas or make meaning murky, and it is true that others may judge us (again, unfairly) for errors and typos in our emails. (Interestingly, one study suggests that the people most bothered by these kinds of errors are not united by age, education, or time spent reading; instead, their commonality is personality type. Extroverts are more willing to overlook written errors that introverted people may judge negatively [Boland and Queen].) In the field of rhetoric and composition, though, we have moved away from a heavy emphasis on correct usage in the past few years. While there is value in correctness, the most important thing is for your meaning to be clear and your ideas to be sound. Too much focus on where the apostrophe goes can detract from the larger issues of how to build an argument, support a stance, or structure an essay. We need to work on those global aspects of writing before getting down to the nitty-gritty of comma usage. As Stephen Pinker put it, For all the vitriol brought out by matters of correct usage, they are the smallest part of good writing. They pale in importance behind coherence, classic style and overcoming the curse of knowledge, to say nothing of standards of intellectual conscientiousness. If you really want to improve the quality of your writing, or if you want to thunder about sins in the writing of others, the principles you should worry about the most are not the ones that govern fused participles and possessive antecedents but the ones that govern critical thinking and factual diligence. (485) A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 204 \n In other words, grammar and usage are only a small part of the larger writing picture. Your instructor may note patterns of error or point out places where a comma would make your writing clearer--but it will not be the primary focus of most college writing classes. However, when you leave school, it will be up to you to judge the rhetorical situation of any piece of writing and handle correctness accordingly. You already know this subconsciously; just think again about the example of texting a friend versus emailing an instructor. English usage and mechanics are another way to make your writing more effective, powerful, and clear. Think of them as tools to help you strengthen the rhetorical impact of your words and ideas. How can you use these tools to clarify your meaning and help your readers focus on the good stuff? See the \"Additional Resources\" and \"Activities\" sections for more practical and specific guidance on comma usage and more. \n##### Passive And Active Voice \n Maybe this is a familiar phrase: \"Ugh, he's so passive! Why won't he speak up for himself?\" When we describe a person as passive, we mean that they let things happen to them. They don't take action; instead, they allow things to happen without resistance. That definition is helpful when learning about passive voice in writing as well. In passive voice, the object (or recipient) of the action becomes the subject of the sentence. In other words, the focus is on who (or what) received the action rather than on who (or what) completed the action. Here's an example to show you what I mean: Passive: The coffee was drunk by Poppy. Active: Poppy drank the coffee. Both of these sentences are grammatically correct, but as you can see, they have some notable differences. The passive construction is a little longer, and it emphasizes the coffee (the recipient of the action) rather than Poppy (the doer of the action). The active version is more concise, and it focuses on Poppy and her actions. These may seem like small differences, but they add up over the course of a paper. Active voice is often considered sharper, clearer, and cleaner than passive voice. In the example above, you can see why. So why would anyone ever use passive voice? Well, in some cases, the doer of the action is unknown or irrelevant, as in \"The package was delivered this morning\" (passive). We don't know who delivered it, and while the delivery person matters as a human, they don't matter in the meaning of this sentence. In other cases, the receiver of the action is more important than the doer; we emphasize the recipient of the action because that's what matters in the context of the sentence. For example, we almost always say, \"She was born in 1994,\" which is a passive construction. In this situation, who did the action (her mother) is not the most relevant information. If we wrote, \"Her mother gave birth to her in 1994\" (active voice), we would be making a conscious decision to highlight her mother's role in the moment. 205 COLLECTED WORKS \n This is often true in technical and scientific writing as well, which is why the passive voice is more common in STEM fields. In a lab report, for example, the experiment is more important than the researcher; for that reason, it's common to write in the passive voice. For example, \"Hydrochloric acid was then added\" (passive) is more common than \"I added hydrochloric acid.\" We also often use passive voice to avoid blaming others in a negative situation. In some cases, this is considered the most polite route. It may feel accusatory or aggressive to say, \"You did this assignment incorrectly\" (active). Instead, we might say, \"This assignment was done incorrectly.\" Again, both are correct, but we can make a writerly choice here to focus on the receiver of the action (the assignment) and in this case spare someone's feelings. However, be careful! The passive voice is sometimes used in this way to avoid taking responsibility. Newspapers famously use passive voice in a way that emphasizes the victims rather than the criminals. Politicians, corporations, and regular people also use the passive voice to duck blame or responsibility. Consider the following examples: Passive: She was assaulted at a party. Active: An unknown male assaulted her at a party. Passive: Authors of color have been historically marginalized by the publishing industry. Active: Historically, the publishing industry marginalized authors of color. Passive: Mistakes were made. Active: We made a mistake. (Or even more unthinkable: I made a mistake.) How does the active voice shift the focus of the sentence and potentially the cultural framing of sexual assault, racism, and other errors? You can see how the use of active or passive voice can be a political choice as well as a stylistic one. Passive voice isn't grammatically incorrect, and it has its place. The key (as with all elements of style) is to consider how its use impacts your writing. Notice it and make a choice about when to use it and when to cut it. You can check your own writing for passive voice. Does the \"doer\" of the action come after the action (the thing that was done)? Or does the doer disappear completely? If so, the sentence is likely in a passive voice. You can also look for this construction in your sentences: \n##### Point Of View: To \"I\" Or Not To \"I\" \n As a general rule, an \"I\" voice will give your writing a more personal and subjective feel. That's why a first-person perspective is common in memoirs and personal essays but rarely seen in STEM fields (although some scientific articles do refer to the researchers as \"we,\" which is a personal pronoun but somehow slightly less intimate than \"I\"). Academic writing in the humanities and social sciences is somewhere in between these two extremes--depending on the subject and context, a writer can make their own choice. Many well-known scholars in these fields use an \"I\" in their academic papers, especially if their connection to the subject \n### \"TO BE\" VERB (IS, ARE, WAS, ETC.) + \n### PAST PARTICIPLE (WALKED, TAKEN, \n### SEEN, ETC.) = PASSIVE VOICE \n A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 206 \n is important to understanding their perspective or point. Some authors use it just a little bit--maybe they open their article with a personal anecdote before moving into a more objective tone--while others use it throughout a piece of writing. It's worth noting that although writing without the \"I\" can be read as more objective, all writing is created by people with perspectives and stances. If I make an argument, it doesn't matter if I frame it with \"I argue\" or not; it's still my argument. From one perspective, then, using an \"I\" voice is simply more transparent about the subjectivity of the work. The \"I\" voice is slightly less formal, although it can still have a place in academic writing. It can also feel quite personal, depending on the subject.

Since the binary number 0110 is positive six, that must mean that what we started with - 1010 - must be negative six. \n### Chapter 8 \n## Logic \nTo a great extent, logic governs the way your mind works, even among so-called \"irrational people.\" If we want to capture logical processes and represent them in a computer program, we need a way to express these thoughts in a form suitable for automated reasoning. This is primarily why computer scientists study logic. \nInterestingly, the material in this chapter covers the very bottom and the very top of the technology stack. At the bottom, we have actual physical hardware that consists of circuits turning bits on and off. The rules that govern when we want to turn which bits on and off are based on \"logic gates,\" or tiny physical devices that implement the logical principles of this chapter on a micro scale. At the other end of the spectrum, we have highly abstract programs aiming towards \"artificial intelligence.\" These systems are centered around a \"knowledge base\" of accumulated facts, and regularly examine those known facts to make decisions and draw additional conclusions. What does a knowledge base consist of? You guessed it: logical statements that are described in this chapter. \n**8.1 Propositional logic** \nThe simpler -- but less powerful -- of the two logic systems we'll study is called **propositional logic**. It has this name because the core building block is the **proposition**. A proposition is simply a \n 197 \n198 CHAPTER 8. LOGIC \nstatement that has a \"truth value,\" which means that it is either true or false. The statement \"all plants are living beings\" could be a proposition, as could \"Barack Obama was the first AfricanAmerican President\" and \"Kim Kardashian will play the title role in _Thor: Love and Thunder_ .\" By contrast, questions like \"are you okay?\" cannot be propositions, nor can commands like \"hurry up and answer already!\" or phrases like \"Lynn's newborn schnauzer,\" because they are not statements that can be true or false. (Linguistically speaking, propositions have to be in the indicative mood.) \nWe normally use capital letters (what else?) to denote propositions, like: \n Let A be the proposition that UMW is in Virginia. Let B be the proposition that the King of England is female. Let C be the proposition that dogs are carnivores. \nDon't forget that a proposition doesn't have to be true in order to be a valid proposition (B is still a proposition, for example). It just matters that it is labeled and that it has the potential to be true or false. \nPropositions are considered **atomic**. This means that they are _indivisible_ : to the logic system itself, or to a computer program, they are simply an opaque chunk of truth (or falsity) called \"A\" or whatever. When we humans read the description of A, we realize that it has to do with the location of a particular institution of higher education, and with the state of the union that it might reside (or not reside) in. All this is invisible to an artificially intelligent agent, however, which treats \"A\" as nothing more than a stand-in label for a statement that has no further discernible structure. \nSo things are pretty boring so far. We can define and label propositions, but none of them have any connections to the others. We change that by introducing **logical operators** (also called **logical connectives** ) with which we can build up compound constructions out of multiple propositions. The six connectives we'll learn are: \n8.1. PROPOSITIONAL LOGIC 199 \n  -- \"and\" ! -- \"not\"  -- \"or\" = -- \"implies\" (or \"if... then... \")  -- \"xor\" (exclusive \"or\") = -- \"equiv\" (equivalent) \nJust as the ordinary algebraic operators (+, -, _etc._ ) can be used to join numbers and produce another number, and just as the set operators can be used to join sets and produce another set, the logical operators can be used to join propositions and produce another proposition. The expression \"34 + 59\" produces the number 93. The expression \"{X,Y}{Y,Z}\" produces the set {X,Y,Z}. And the expression \"A  B\" produces the value false, since although UMW is located in Virginia, the King is not female. \nLet's run through the six operators, some of which are intuitive and some of which are not: \n **(\"and\")** The proposition XY is true when both X and Y are true propositions. \"AC\" represents the proposition \"UMW is in Virginia _and_ dogs are carnivores,\" which has a truth value of true since both components are true. This operation is sometimes called a **conjunction**. Notice that the \"\" sign somewhat resembles the \"\" sign for set intersection. This is not an accident. An element is in the intersection of two sets if it is a member of the first _and_ the second set. Hence mathematicians have chosen symbols which reinforce this connection. \n **(\"or\")** The proposition XY is true when either X or Y (or both) are true propositions. \"BC\" represents the proposition \"The King of England is female _or_ dogs are carnivores,\" which has a truth value of true since the second component is true. This operation is sometimes called a **disjunction**. The  looks somewhat like the \"\" sign for set union, since an element is in the union of two sets if it is an element of the first set _or_ the second set (or both). This operator is sometimes called an \"inclusive or\" since it is true if both propositions are true. \n200 CHAPTER 8. LOGIC \n **(\"xor\")** The  operator is just like  except that it's _exclusive_ : the proposition XY is true when _either_ X _or_ Y (but not both) are true propositions. \"BC\" and \"BC\" are both true, but \"AC\" is false, since UMW is in Virginia _and_ dogs are carnivores. \n! **(\"not\")** This operator is different from the others in that it's _unary_ , which means that it only operates on one proposition instead of two. All it does is flip the value from true to false (or vice versa.) The proposition \"A\" is true, but the proposition \"!A\" is false. \"!B,\" on the other hand, is true. This operation is sometimes called a **negation**. \n= **(\"implies\")** Okay, now for the toughest one. We're going to spend significant time thinking through this one carefully, because it's both important (in some ways, the most important of the operators) and also potentially baffling. I've studied this stuff for years, and I still sometimes get stuck when trying to figure out =. \n If we say \"X=Y,\" we're claiming that \" if X is true, then Y is true.\" Note carefully that we are not claiming that X itself is true. We're simply asserting that if it's true, then Y must necessarily also be true. We call the first part of a = proposition the premise , and the second part the conclusion. Here, X is the premise and Y the conclusion. \n So far, it seems easy. It gets a little slippery when you realize that the only claim \"X=Y\" is making is: \" if X is true, then Y must be true\". If X is not true, then \"X=Y\" is making no claim at all. \n Confusingly enough, this means that except for the one scenario where X is true but Y is false, the statement \"X=Y itself\" is always true. So, besides the obviously sensible case when X and Y are both true, X=Y is true even when: (1) X is false and Y is true, and (2) X is false and Y is false. Or, to put it succinctly: X=Y is true whenever either X is false or Y is true or both. \n8.1. PROPOSITIONAL LOGIC 201 \n For example, A=C is a true proposition, believe it or not. In English, it says \"UMW being in Virginia implies that dogs are carnivores.\" The proposition B=A is also true: \"The King of England being female implies that UMW is in Virginia.\" What possible sense can we make out of these nonsensical claims? \n The key to understanding it, for me at least, is twofold. First, remember that to a computer (or a logic system), there is no meaning to the propositions: they're simply atomic building blocks, each of which is true or false. So the fact that to a human, the content of the propositions might have nothing to do with each other -- English Kings and dogs -- is irrelevant to a computer: it just thinks indifferently in terms of \"X\" and \"Y,\" and has no idea what real-world entities any of this refers to. Second, think in terms of ruling out counterexamples. When I assert X=Y, what I'm saying is \"it's impossible for X to be true and Y false, because X's truthfulness would imply Y's truthfulness.\" Just as when I assert XY I'm promising that either X or Y is true (or both), when I assert X=Y I'm promising that either X is false or Y is true (or both). \n In this way, it starts to make sense when someone says, \"Iowa being in the Southern hemisphere implies that Batman's cape is red.\" That assertion is like a promise: \" if it turns out that Iowa is in the Southern hemisphere, then I guarantee Batman's cape is red.\" But since Iowa isn't in the Southern hemisphere, all bets are off. The conclusion was conditional on the premise. \n The reason this operator is so important is that in artificial intelligence, the name of the game is concluding new facts from known existing facts, so that knowledge is increased. Every time a 'bot learns that X=Y is true, and then also learns that the premise (X) is true, it can conclude that the conclusion (Y) is true, even if it was never explicitly told that Y was true. This rule of logic is called modus ponens , and is the workhorse of automated knowledge bases. \n202 CHAPTER 8. LOGIC \n= **(\"equiv\")** Finally, the proposition X=Y is true whenever X and Y have the same value: they're either both true, or both false. This can be seen as \"implies in both directions,\" since X=Y means \"if X is true, then Y is true; and if Y is true, then X is true.\" This operator is also the inverse of , since XY is true only if X and Y are different, and X=Y is true only if they're the same. \nThese operators, which each produce another proposition (called a **compound proposition** ) from the proposition(s) they operate on, can be combined to form complex expressions.

But what makes their papers far more effective is if they can take ownership of the prompt--in other words, if they can consider a way of making it more than simply an assignment, making it an opportunity for them to address an issue they are passionate about to a specific audience. To help them develop this sense of audience and purpose, a discussion of exigency can be beneficial. This is one reason to talk about exigency at the beginning of the writing project. The discussion about it will differ depending on how narrowly their purpose and audience are being defined by the writing prompt, but either way, the beginning of the project is the first and probably best place to discuss exigency. \n#### WORKS CITED \n#### TEACHER RESOURCES FOR EXIGENCY: WHAT MAKES MY \n#### MESSAGE INDISPENSABLE TO MY READER BY QUENTIN VIEREGGE \n A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 114 \n It can also be helpful to discuss exigency when students are writing their introductory paragraphs or concluding paragraphs or as they are revising their drafts to craft a more compelling argument. These three points in the composition process are what I think of as global points, where students have an opportunity to look at the writing assignment holistically. As a reader--in and out of the classroom--the introduction and conclusion are often where I find exigent moments, and I tell students this, perhaps bringing in examples for them to review and discuss. As a writer, it's often in the middle or at the end of the writing process that I can better grasp the exigency of an argument for both myself and my readers, and this can be a point of discussion in class as well. As my chapter asserts, asking students to think in terms of author and reader personas may also help lead to discussions on exigency. Asking students to think of personas invites them to consider what agenda or values correspond with that persona and how those considerations can help writers establish connections with their readers. Finally, exigency isn't just connected to global issues like persona, audience, and purpose; it can also be thought of in terms of templates and well-worn rhetorical moves. Showing students rhetorical patterns connected to exigency, such as how writers explain a \"gap in the research,\" can help make it clear how they can articulate exigency at the sentence or passage level. \n##### DISCUSSION QUESTIONS \n1.

What writers need is revision. Novice writers, experienced writers, all writers. Anyone interested in writing clearer, stronger, more persuasive and passionate prose, even those of us who are procrastinators panicking because we need to get a project finished or a paper written and it's 2:00 a.m. the night before our deadline--writers need revision because revision is not a discrete step. Revision is not the thing writers do when they're done writing. Revision is the writing. It's important to keep in mind I'm not talking about revision as proofreading or copyediting; no amount of grammatical, spelling, and style corrections transforms a piece of writing like focused attention to fundamental questions about purpose, evidence, and organization. That, to me, is revision: the heavy lifting of working through why I'm writing, who I'm writing for, and how I structure writing logically and effectively. My writing students are usually relieved to hear that published authors often find writing just as fraught as they do. Like college students, people paid to write--the journalists and the novelists and the technical writers--more often than not despair at the difference between what's in their heads and hearts and what ends up on the page the first time around. The professionals are just a little better at waiting things out, pushing through what Anne Lamott calls \"shitty first drafts\" and all the ones that follow, the revision of a tenth and a thirteenth and a twenty-third draft. In class, I show a YouTube video by Tim Weninger, a computer scientist and engineer at the University of Notre Dame. In the video, Weninger stitches together his revisions of a research paper. In my class, we play a game, guessing how many revisions Weninger did. The answer--463!--almost always surprises them. It still sometimes surprises me. And sure, some of those revisions are small, fiddly changes. But most of the time, even watching this quickly on classroom monitors, my students notice Weninger aims for the jugular in his writing. He's after a wholesale overhaul of his argument and of his larger work. \n#### REVISION IS WRITING \n A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 116 \n However, talking about revision in terms of numbers of drafts implies that all writing, all writers, and all revision work one way: hit your target draft number, like your daily Fitbit goals, and you magically get good writing. But more revision isn't necessarily better. Effective revising isn't making changes for the sake of change but instead making smarter changes. And professional writers--practiced writers--have this awareness even if they aren't aware of it. In Stephen King's memoir On Writing , he calls this instinct the ideal reader: an imagined person a writer knows and trusts but rewrites in response to, a kind of collaborative dance between writer and reader. To writers, the act of writing is an act of thinking. One writer in a landmark study comparing the habits of experienced writers to those of novices called their first drafts \"the kernel.\" If you're someone like me who is constantly struggling to demystify this complex cognitive thing we humans do, that metaphor of writing as a seed is revelatory. Revision is not a sign of weakness or inexperience or poor writing. It is the writing. The more writers push through chaos to get to the good stuff, the more they revise. The more writers revise, whether that be the keystrokes they sweat in front of a blinking, demanding cursor or the unofficial revising they do in our heads when they're showering or driving or running, the more the ideal reader becomes a part of their craft and muscle memory, of who they are as writers, so at some point, they may not know where the writing stops and the revision begins. Because writing and revision are impossible to untangle, revision is just as situational and interpretive as writing. In other words, writers interact with readers--writing and revision are social, responsive, and communal. Take Martin Luther King Jr.'s \"I Have a Dream\" speech. King gave a rough draft of the most famous American speech of the twentieth century to eighteen hundred people crammed into a gymnasium in Rocky Mount, North Carolina, in November of \n1962. Seven months later, King gave another revision of the speech to a gathering of political and spiritual leaders, musicians, and activists in Detroit. In August of 1963, in front of the Lincoln Memorial, King riffed and reworked and rebuilt what he preached in Rocky Mount and Detroit, ad-libbing, deleting, and flipping lines. \"I Have a Dream\" is what Americans remember today, engraved in our collective memories, archives, and textbooks as a symbol of an entire era, but King's famous refrain singing his vision for a less racially divided country was not even part of his speech's official text that day. Was King writing a new speech? Was he done with the Rocky Mount or Detroit one? \"I Have a Dream\" was not one speech but many, written and rewritten. King was not content to let his words sit, but like any practiced writer working out his muscles, he revised and riffed, adapting it for new audiences and purposes. All this revision talk could lead to the counterargument that revision is a death spiral, a way of shoving off the potential critique of a finished draft forever. Tinkering is something we think of as quaint but not very efficient. Writers can always make the excuse that something is a work in progress, that they just don't have time for all this revision today. But this critique echoes the point that writing is social and responsive to its readers. Writing is almost always meant to be read and responded to, not hoarded away. A recent large-scale study on writing's impact on learning supports the idea that specific interventions in the writing process matter more in learning to write rather than how much \n#### REVISION: ALIVE AND KICKING \n 117 COLLECTED WORKS \nstudents are writing (Anderson et al.). Among these useful interventions are participation in a lively revision culture and an interactive and social writing process such as talking over drafts--soliciting feedback from instructors and classmates. Extending the modern definition of writing more broadly to composing in any medium, revision is as bound to writing as breathing is to living. If anything, humans are doing more writing and revision today. Sure, there are people who call themselves writers and mean that it is part of their formal job title. But then there are the greater numbers of us who are writers but don't label ourselves as such, the millions of us just noodling around on Facebook or Snapchat or Instagram. Facebook and Instagram have an edit feature on posts. Google Docs includes a revision history tool. When we send a text and our buzzy little e-devices kick in with autocorrect, changing Linkin Park to Kinky Park, we compensate with frantic asterisks. We edit our comments or return to clarify them; we cannot resist. Revision as writing is an idea that we should not abandon or trash--and it may not even be possible to do so if we tried. The original chapter, Strong Writing and Writers Don't Need Revision by Laura Giovanelli, is from Bad Ideas about Writing \n**1.** One of the headings in this essay is a common saying in the field of rhetoric     and composition: \"revision is writing\" (or sometimes \"writing is revision\").     What does this mean? What does this perspective suggest about the     writing process or how experienced writers write? \n**2.** What revision strategies have you used in the past? What has been     effective for you? \n**3.** What gets in the way of revision? What makes this a difficult process to     undertake? \n**4.** How does the story about Dr. King change your understanding or     perspective on MLK and his fame as one of history's greatest public     speakers? \n**5.** Consider the story about Dr. King's revision process as he wrote \"I Have a     Dream.\" How is the revision process different in public speaking than in     writing a paper? What could transfer, and what could not? \n#### DISCUSSION QUESTIONS \n A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 118 \n**1.** Read Mike Birbiglia's article \"6 Tips for Getting Your Solo Play to     Broadway.\" Although his tone is humorous--Birbiglia is a comedian--he has     some interesting things to say about the revision process in developing his     stand-up special.         How does Birbiglia's process compare or contrast with           what we know of Dr. King's?         Do a little research on other stand-up comedians'           processes. What surprises you about what you learn?           What can you take away? \n**2.** Choose one revision strategy that's new to you (either from discussion in     class or from your own research). Try it out with your own draft. Write a     paragraph reflecting on the process. What surprised you? What did you     learn through this process? In what ways was it helpful, and in what ways     was it not? Will you use it again? \n#### ACTIVITIES \n119 COLLECTED WORKS \n**1.** For more about the relationships between revision, writing experience, and     writing processes, see Alice Horning and Anne Becker's _Revision: History,_     _Theory, and Practice_ (Parlor Press) and Linda Adler-Kassner and Elizabeth     Wardle's _Naming What We Know: Threshold Concepts of Writing Studies_ (Utah     State University Press), specifically Doug Downs's chapter, \"Revision Is     Central to Developing Writing.\" \n**2.** Just a handful of many important studies that have helped writing scholars     better understand what's going on when writers revise are Nancy     Sommers's \"Revision Strategies of Student Writers and Experienced     Writers\"; Lester Faigley and Stephen Witte's \"Analyzing Revision\"; Mina     Shaughnessy's _Errors and Expectations: A Guide for the Teacher of Basic_     _Writing_ (Oxford University Press); and Paul Anderson, Chris Anson, Charles     Paine, and Robert M.

This last point is often not fully appreciated, leading to errors. Be careful not to cavalierly add the cardinalities of nonmutually-exclusive sets! You'll end up double-counting items. \nSo we know that the number of possible license plates is equal to: \n the # of 7-character plates + the # of 6-character plates + the # of 5-character plates + * * * + the # of 1-character plates. \nVery well. We can now figure out each one separately. How do we know how many 7-character plates there are? Well, if every character must be either a letter or a digit, then we have 26 + 10 = 36 choices for each character. This implies 367 different possible 7-character license plates. The total number of plates is therefore: \n 367 + 36^6 + 36^5 + 36^4 + 36^3 + 36^2 + 36 = 80,603,140,212 plates \nwhich is about ten times the population of the earth, so I think we're safe for now. \n6.1. THE FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM 145 \nHere's an interesting thought experiment to test your intuition about numbers. Look at the above calculation, and ask yourself: \"what if the state of Virginia decided, for purposes of consistency, that all license plates _had_ to have the full 7 characters? Would that significantly reduce the total number of possible plates?\" My first inclination would be to say \"yes,\" because we're adding seven things in that equation, and if we mandated 7-character plates for everyone we'd eliminate 6 out of the 7. Surely we'd be in danger of running out of license plates to give to all the cars! But in fact the new total number of plates would turn out to be: \n 367 = 78,364,164,096 plates. \nWow. We've hardly lost _anything_ by scrapping all the less-than-7character plates. Turns out that in comparison with the 7-character plates, all the other lengths were a drop in the bucket. This is a powerful illustration of exponential growth. When you modify the exponent, going from something like 366 to 367 , you get astronomically larger very, very quickly. This is a good thing to know when all you want is an approximation of some quantity. How many passwords are possible in a system that mandates 6-10 characters per password? Well, you can pretty much ignore all the 6-9 character passwords and just count the 10-character passwords, because there are so many more of those. \nOne last tweak to the license plate example before we move on. Suppose (again, for the sake of consistency) that Virginia outlawed personalized plates and gave everyone a randomly generated 7-character plate. Furthermore, the last four characters of the plate had to be _digits_ instead of letters, so that something like \"RFP-6YQ7\" would be impossible. Now how many possible plates would there be? \nIn this case, not each of the k parts of n have an equal number of choices. n 1 through n 3 are still 36, but now n 4 through n 7 are just \n10. So this gives us: \n 36 x 36 x 36 x 10 x 10 x 10 x 10 = 466,560,000 plates \n146 CHAPTER 6. COUNTING \nor only about .006 times as many as before. Better stick with alphanumeric characters for all seven positions. \n**A simple trick** \nSometimes we have something difficult to count, but we can turn it around in terms of something much easier. Often this involves counting the _complement_ of something, then subtracting from the total. \nFor instance, suppose a certain website mandated that user passwords be between 6-10 characters in length -- every character being an uppercase letter, lowercase letter, digit, or special character (*, #, @, % or &) -- but it also required each password to have _at least one digit or special character._ How many passwords are possible? \nWithout the \"at least one digit or special character\" part, it's pretty easy: there are 26 + 26 + 10 + 5 = 67 different choices for each character, so we have \n 6710 + 67^9 + 67^8 + 67^7 + 67^6 = 1,850,456,557,795,600,384 strings. \nBut how do we handle the \"at least one\" part? \nOne way would be to list all the possible ways of having a password with at least one non-alpha character. The non-alpha could appear in the first position, or the second, or the third,... , or the tenth, but of course this only works for 10-digit passwords, and in any event it's not like the _other_ characters couldn't _also_ be non-alpha. It gets messy really fast. \nThere's a simple trick, though, once you realize that it's easy to count the passwords that _don't_ satisfy the extra constraint. Ask yourself this question: out of all the possible strings of 6-10 characters, how many of them _don't_ have at least one non-alpha character? (and are therefore illegal, according to the website rules?) \nIt turns out that's the same as asking \"how many strings are there with 6-10 alphabetic (only) characters?\" which is of course: \n 5210 + 52^9 + 52^8 + 52^7 + 52^6 = 147,389,519,403,536,384 (illegal) passwords. \n6.2. PERMUTATIONS 147 \nNow, all we have to do is subtract to get \ntotal # of strings - # of illegal passwords = # of legit passwords 1,850,456,557,795,600,384 - 147,389,519,403,536,384 = 1,708,735,865,301,022,720 \nlegitimate passwords. Looks like we don't lose much by requiring the non-alpha character. \nThe lesson learned is that if counting the elements in some set involves accounting for a lot of different sticky scenarios, it's worth a try to count the elements _not_ in the set instead, and see if that's easier. \n**6.2 Permutations** \nWhen we're counting things, we often run into permutations. A **permutation** of n distinct objects is an arrangement of them in a sequence. For instance, suppose all three Davies kids need to brush their teeth, but only one of them can use the sink at a time. What order will they brush in? One possibility is Lizzy, then T.J., then Johnny. Another possibility is T.J., then Lizzy, then Johnny. Another is Johnny, then Lizzy, then T.J. These are all different permutations of the Davies kids. Turns out there are six of them (find all 6 for yourself!) \nCounting the number of permutations is just a special application of the Fundamental Theorem of Counting. For the teeth brushing example, we have n = 3 different \"parts\" to the problem, each of which has ni choices to allocate to it. There are three different Davies kids who could brush their teeth first, so n 1 = 3. Once that child is chosen, there are then _two_ remaining children who could brush second, so n 2 = 2. Then, once we've selected a first-brusher and a second-brusher, there's only one remaining choice for the third-brusher, so n 3 = 1. This means the total number of possible brushing orders is: \n 3 x 2 x 1 = 6. \n148 CHAPTER 6. COUNTING \nThis pattern comes up so much that mathematicians have established a special notation for it: \n n x (n - 1) x (n - 2) x * * * x 1 = n! (\"n-factorial\") \nWe say there are \"3-factorial\" different brushing orders for the Davies kids. For our purposes the notion of factorial will only apply for integers, so there's no such thing as 23.46! or p!. (In advanced computer science applications, however, mathematicians sometimes do define factorial for non-integers.) We also define 0! to be 1, which might surprise you. \nThis comes up a heck of a lot. If I give you a jumbled set of letters to unscramble, like \"KRIBS\" (think of the Jumble(r)^ word game in the newspaper), how many different unscramblings are there? The answer is 5!, or 120, one of which is BRISK. Let's say I shuffle a deck of cards before playing War.^2 How many different games of War are there? The answer is 52!, since any of the cards in the deck might be shuffled on top, then any _but_ that top card could be second, then any _but_ those two could be third, _etc._ Ten packets arrive near-simultaneously at a network router. How many ways can they be queued up for transmission? 10! ways, just like a larger Davies family. \nThe factorial function grows really, really fast, by the way, even faster than exponential functions. A five letter word like \"BRISK\" has 120 permutations, but \"AMBIDEXTROUSLY\" has 87,178,291,200, ten times the population of the earth. The number of ways to shuffle a deck is \n80,658,175,170,944,942,408,940,349,866,698,506,766,127,860,028,660,283,290,685,487,972,352 \nso I don't think my boys will end up playing the same War game twice any time soon, nor my wife and I the same bridge hand. \n(^2) \"War\" is a mindless card game which involves no strategy or decisionmaking on the part of the players. Once you shuffle the initial deck, the entire outcome of the game is fixed. \n6.2. PERMUTATIONS 149 \n**Enumerating permutations** \nWe've discovered that there are 120 permutations of BRISK, but how would we go about listing them all? You can play around with the Davies kids and stumble upon all 6 permutations, but for larger numbers it's harder. We need a systematic way. \nTwo of the easiest ways to enumerate permutations involve recursion. Here's one: \n**Algorithm #1 for enumerating permutations** \n1. Begin with a set of n objects. \n a) If n = 1, there is only one permutation; namely, the object itself. b) Otherwise, remove one of the objects, and find the permutations of the remaining n - 1 objects. Then, insert the removed object at every possible position, creating another permutation each time. \nAs always with recursion, solving a bigger problem depends on solving smaller problems. Let's start with RISK. We've already discovered from the toothbrushing example that the permutations of ISK are ISK, IKS, SIK, SKI, KIS, and KSI. So to find the permutations of RISK, we insert an R into _each_ possible location for _each_ of these ISK-permutations. This gives us: \n R ISK I R SK IS R K ISK R R IKS I R KS IK R S IKS R R SIK * * * \n150 CHAPTER 6. COUNTING \nand so on. Once we have the RISK permutations, we can generate the BRISK permutations in the same way: \n B RISK R B ISK RI B SK RIS B K RISK B B IRSK I B RSK IR B SK IRS B K IRSK B B RSIK * * * \nAnother algorithm to achieve the same goal (though in a different order) is as follows: \n**Algorithm #2 for enumerating permutations** \n1. Begin with a set of n objects. \n a) If n = 1, there is only one permutation; namely, the object itself. b) Otherwise, remove each of the objects in turn, and prepend that object to the permutations of all the others, creating another permutation each time. \nI find this one a little easier to get my head around, but in the end it's personal preference. The permutations of BRISK are: \"B followed by all the permutations of RISK, plus R followed by all the permutations of BISK, plus I followed by all the permutations of BRSK, _etc._ \" So the first few permutations of a 4-letter word are: \n R I S K R I K S R S I K \n6.2. PERMUTATIONS 151 \n R S K I R K I S R K S I I R S K I R K S I S R K I S K R I K R S I K S R S R I K * * * \nThen, for the 5-letter word: \n B R I S K B R I K S B R S I K B R S K I B R K I S B R K S I B I R S K B I R K S * * * \n**Partial permutations** \nSometimes we want to count the permutations of a set, but only want to choose _some_ of the items each time, not all of them. For example, consider a golf tournament in which the top ten finishers (out of 45) all receive prize money, with the first place winner receiving the most, the second place finisher a lesser amount, and so on down to tenth place, who receives a nominal prize. How many different finishes are possible to the tournament? \nIn this case, we want to know how many different orderings of golfers there are, but it turns out that past tenth place, we don't care what order they finished in. All that matters is the first ten places. If the top ten are 1.Tiger, 2.Phil, 3.Lee, 4.Rory,... , and \n152 CHAPTER 6.

Learn about the meaning of this term in Proof Technique C. Theorem REMEF Row-Equivalent Matrix in Echelon Form Suppose A is a matrix. Then there is a matrix B so that \n1. A and B are row-equivalent. \n2. B is in reduced row-echelon form. \n Proof. Suppose that A has m rows and n columns. We will describe a process for converting A into B via row operations. This procedure is known as Gauss-Jordan elimination. Tracing through this procedure will be easier if you recognize that i refers to a row that is being converted, j refers to a column that is being converted, and r keeps track of the number of nonzero rows. Here we go. \n1. Set j = 0 and r = 0. \n2. Increase j by 1. If j now equals n + 1, then stop. \n3. Examine the entries of A in column j located in rows r + 1 through m. If all     of these entries are zero, then go to Step 2. \n4. Choose a row from rows r + 1 through m with a nonzero entry in column j.     Let i denote the index for this row. \n5. Increase r by 1. \n6. Use the first row operation to swap rows i and r. \n7. Use the second row operation to convert the entry in row r and column j to a     1. \n8. Use the third row operation with row r to convert every other entry of column     j to zero. \n9. Go to Step 2. \n The result of this procedure is that the matrix A is converted to a matrix in reduced row-echelon form, which we will refer to as B. We need to now prove this claim by showing that the converted matrix has the requisite properties of Definition RREF. First, the matrix is only converted through row operations (Steps 6, 7, 8), so A and B are row-equivalent (Definition REM). It is a bit more work to be certain that B is in reduced row-echelon form. We claim that as we begin Step 2, the first j columns of the matrix are in reduced row-echelon form with r nonzero rows. Certainly this is true at the start when j = 0, since the matrix has no columns and so vacuously meets the conditions of Definition RREF with r = 0 nonzero rows. In Step 2 we increase j by 1 and begin to work with the next column. There are two possible outcomes for Step 3. Suppose that every entry of column j in rows r + 1 through m is zero. Then with no changes we recognize that the first j columns \n SSR R E F B e e z e r : A F i r s t C o u r s e i n L i n e a r A l g e b r a 25 \n of the matrix has its first r rows still in reduced-row echelon form, with the final m - r rows still all zero. Suppose instead that the entry in row i of column j is nonzero. Notice that since r + 1 <= i <= m, we know the first j - 1 entries of this row are all zero. Now, in Step 5 we increase r by 1, and then embark on building a new nonzero row. In Step 6 we swap row r and row i. In the first j columns, the first r - 1 rows remain in reduced row-echelon form after the swap. In Step 7 we multiply row r by a nonzero scalar, creating a 1 in the entry in column j of row i, and not changing any other rows. This new leading 1 is the first nonzero entry in its row, and is located to the right of all the leading 1's in the preceding r - 1 rows. With Step 8 we insure that every entry in the column with this new leading 1 is now zero, as required for reduced row-echelon form. Also, rows r + 1 through m are now all zeros in the first j columns, so we now only have one new nonzero row, consistent with our increase of r by one. Furthermore, since the first j - 1 entries of row r are zero, the employment of the third row operation does not destroy any of the necessary features of rows 1 through r - 1 and rows r + 1 through m, in columns 1 through j - 1. So at this stage, the first j columns of the matrix are in reduced row-echelon form. When Step 2 finally increases j to n + 1, then the procedure is completed and the full n columns of the matrix are in reduced row-echelon form, with the value of r correctly recording the number of nonzero rows. \u0004 \n The procedure given in the proof of Theorem REMEF can be more precisely described using a pseudo-code version of a computer program. Single-letter variables, like m, n, i, j, r have the same meanings as above. := is assignment of the value on the right to the variable on the left, A[i,j] is the equivalent of the matrix entry [A]ij , while == is an equality test and <> is a \"not equals\" test. \n input m, n and A r := 0 for j := 1 to n i := r+1 while i <= m and A[i,j] == 0 i := i+1 if i < m+1 r := r+1 swap rows i and r of A (row op 1) scale A[r,j] to a leading 1 (row op 2) for k := 1 to m, k <> r make A[k,j] zero (row op 3, employing row r) output r and A \nNotice that as a practical matter the \"and\" used in the conditional statement of the while statement should be of the \"short-circuit\" variety so that the array access that follows is not out-of-bounds. So now we can put it all together. Begin with a system of linear equations (Definition SLE), and represent the system by its augmented matrix (Definition AM). Use row operations (Definition RO) to convert this matrix into reduced row-echelon form (Definition RREF), using the procedure outlined in the proof of Theorem REMEF. Theorem REMEF also tells us we can always accomplish this, and that the result is row-equivalent (Definition REM) to the original augmented matrix. Since the matrix in reduced-row echelon form has the same solution set, we can analyze the row-reduced version instead of the original matrix, viewing it as the augmented matrix of a different system of equations. The beauty of augmented matrices in reduced row-echelon form is that the solution sets to the systems they represent can be easily determined, as we will see in the next few examples and in the next section. \n SSR R E F B e e z e r : A F i r s t C o u r s e i n L i n e a r A l g e b r a 26 \nWe will see through the course that almost every interesting property of a matrix can be discerned by looking at a row-equivalent matrix in reduced row-echelon form. For this reason it is important to know that the matrix B is guaranteed to exist by Theorem REMEF is also unique. Two proof techniques are applicable to the proof. First, head out and read two proof techniques: Proof Technique CD and Proof Technique U. Theorem RREFU Reduced Row-Echelon Form is Unique Suppose that A is an m x n matrix and that B and C are m x n matrices that are row-equivalent to A and in reduced row-echelon form. Then B = C. \n Proof. We need to begin with no assumptions about any relationships between B and C, other than they are both in reduced row-echelon form, and they are both row-equivalent to A. If B and C are both row-equivalent to A, then they are row-equivalent to each other. Repeated row operations on a matrix combine the rows with each other using operations that are linear, and are identical in each column. A key observation for this proof is that each individual row of B is linearly related to the rows of C. This relationship is different for each row of B, but once we fix a row, the relationship is the same across columns. More precisely, there are scalars dik, 1 <= i, k <= m such that for any 1 <= i <= m, 1 <= j <= n, \n [B]ij = \n ^ m \n k=1 \n dik [C]kj \nYou should read this as saying that an entry of row i of B (in column j) is a linear function of the entries of all the rows of C that are also in column j, and the scalars (dik) depend on which row of B we are considering (the i subscript on dik), but are the same for every column (no dependence on j in dik). This idea may be complicated now, but will feel more familiar once we discuss \"linear combinations\" (Definition LCCV) and moreso when we discuss \"row spaces\" (Definition RSM). For now, spend some time carefully working Exercise RREF.M40, which is designed to illustrate the origins of this expression. This completes our exploitation of the row-equivalence of B and C. We now repeatedly exploit the fact that B and C are in reduced row-echelon form. Recall that a pivot column is all zeros, except a single one. More carefully, if R is a matrix in reduced row-echelon form, and d` is the index of a pivot column, then [R]kd` = 1 precisely when k = ` and is otherwise zero. Notice also that any entry of R that is both below the entry in row ` and to the left of column d` is also zero (with below and left understood to include equality). In other words, look at examples of matrices in reduced row-echelon form and choose a leading 1 (with a box around it). The rest of the column is also zeros, and the lower left \"quadrant\" of the matrix that begins here is totally zeros. Assuming no relationship about the form of B and C, let B have r nonzero rows and denote the pivot columns as D = {d 1 , d 2 , d 3 ,... , dr }. For C let r'^ denote the number of nonzero rows and denote the pivot columns as D'^ = { d' 1 , d' 2 , d' 3 ,... , d'r'^ } (Definition RREF). There are four steps in the proof, and the first three are about showing that B and C have the same number of pivot columns, in the same places. In other words, the \"primed\" symbols are a necessary fiction. First Step. Suppose that d 1 < d' 1. Then 1 = [B] 1 d 1 Definition RREF \n = \n ^ m \n k=1 \n d 1 k [C]kd 1 \nSSR R E F B e e z e r : A F i r s t C o u r s e i n L i n e a r A l g e b r a 27 \n = \n ^ m \n k=1 \n d 1 k(0) d 1 < d' 1 \n = 0 \nThe entries of C are all zero since they are left and below of the leading 1 in row 1 and column d' 1 of C. This is a contradiction, so we know that d 1 >= d' 1. By an entirely similar argument, reversing the roles of B and C, we could conclude that d 1 <= d' 1. Together this means that d 1 = d' 1. Second Step. Suppose that we have determined that d 1 = d' 1 , d 2 = d' 2 , d </passage>"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<tool_call>\\n{\"arguments\": {\"queries\": ['Based on the information in the text, what can we infer about the process of converting a matrix into reduced row-echelon form?', 'How does the fact that B and C are row-equivalent contribute to the proof of Theorem RREFU?', 'Can we infer any limitations or drawbacks of using the Gauss-Jordan elimination procedure to convert a matrix into reduced row-echelon form?'], \"name\": \"ExpertQAExtractor\"}}\\n</tool_call>"}]}

Take a closer look, and you'll discover that most of these are pretty thick, dense volumes packed with lots of equations and proofs. They're principled approaches, written by mathematicians and (seemingly) to mathematicians. I speak with complete frankness when I say I'm comforted to know that the human race is well covered in this area. We need smart people who can derive complex expressions and prove theorems from scratch, and I'm glad we have them. \nYour average computer science practitioner, however, might be better served by a different approach. There are elements to the discrete math mindset that a budding software developer needs experience with. This is why discrete math is (properly, I believe) part of the mandatory curriculum for most computer science undergraduate programs. But for future programmers and engineers, the emphasis should be different than it is for mathematicians and researchers in computing theory. A practical computer scientist mostly needs to be able to _use_ these tools, not to _derive_ them. She needs familiarity, and practice, with the fundamental concepts and the thought processes they involve. The number of times the average software developer will need to construct a proof in graph theory is probably near zero. But the times she'll find it useful to reason about probability, logic, or the properties of collections are frequent. \nI believe the majority of computer science students benefit most from simply gaining an appreciation for the richness and rigor of \n iii \niv PREFACE \nthis material, what it means, and how it impacts their discipline. Becoming an expert theorem prover is not required, nor is deriving closed-form expressions for the sizes of trees with esoteric properties. Basic fluency with each topic area, and an intuition about when it can be applied, is the proper aim for most of those who would go forward and build tomorrow's technology. \nTo this end, the book in your hands is a quick guided tour of introductory-level discrete mathematics. It's like a cool, brisk walk through a pretty forest. I point out the notable features of the landscape and try to instill a sense of appreciation and even of awe. I want the reader to get a feel for the lay of the land, and a little exercise. If the student acquires the requisite vocabulary, gets some practice playing with the toys, and learns to start thinking in terms of the concepts here described, I will count it as a success. \n## Acknowledgements \nA hearty thanks to Karen Anewalt, Crystal Burson, Prafulla Giri, Tayyar Hussain, Jennifer Magee, Veena Ravishankar, Jacob Shtabnoy, and a decade's worth of awesome UMW Computer Science students for their many suggestions and corrections to make this text better! \n v \n### Chapter 1 \n## Meetup at the trailhead \nBefore we set out on our \"cool, brisk walk,\" let's get oriented. What _is_ discrete mathematics, anyway? Why is it called that? What does it encompass? And what is it good for? \nLet's take the two words of the subject, in reverse order. First, _math_. When most people hear \"math,\" they think \"numbers.\" After all, isn't math the study of quantity? And isn't that the class where we first learned to count, add, and multiply? \nMathematics certainly has its root in the study of numbers -- specifically, the \"natural numbers\" (the integers from 1 on up) that fascinated the ancient Greeks. Yet math is broader than this, almost to the point where numbers can be considered a special case of something deeper. In this book, when we talk about trees, sets, or formal logic, there might not be a number in sight. \nMath is about **abstract, conceptual objects that have properties, and the implications of those properties.** An \"object\" can be any kind of \"thought material\" that we can define and reason about precisely. Much of math deals with questions like, \"suppose we defined a certain kind of thing that had certain attributes. What would be the implications of this, if we reasoned it all the way out?\" The \"thing\" may or may not be numerical, whatever it turns out to be. Like a number, however, it will be crisply defined, have certain known aspects to it, and be capable of combining with other things in some way. \n 1 \n2 CHAPTER 1. MEETUP AT THE TRAILHEAD \nFundamental to math is that it deals with the _abstract_. Abstract, which is the opposite of concrete, essentially means something that can't be perceived with the senses. A computer chip is concrete: you can touch it, you can see it. A number is not; nor is a function, a binary tree, or a logical implication. The only way to perceive these things is with the power of the mind. We will write expressions and draw pictures of many of our mathematical structures in order to help visualize them, and nearly everything we study will have practical applications whereby the abstractness gets grounded in concreteness for some useful purpose. But the underlying mathematical entity remains abstract and ethereal -- only accessible to the mind's eye. We may use a pencil to form the figure \"5\" on a piece of paper, but that is only a concrete manifestation of the underlying concept of \"five-ness.\" Don't mistake the picture or the symbol for the thing itself, which always transcends any mere physical representation. \nThe other word in the name of our subject is \"discrete\" (not to be confused with \"discreet,\" which means something else entirely). The best way to appreciate what discrete means is to contrast it with its opposite, continuous. Consider the following list: \n Discrete Continuous whole numbers (Z) real numbers (R) int double digital analog quantum continuum counting measuring number theory analysis S \n  \n- (^) dxd What do the left-hand entries have in common? They describe things that are measured in crisp, distinct intervals, rather than varying smoothly over a range. Discrete things jump suddenly from position to position, with rigid precision. If you're 5 feet tall, you might some day grow to 5.3 feet; but though there might be 5 \n 3 \npeople in your family, there will never be 5.3 of them (although there could be 6 someday). \nThe last couple of entries on this list are worth a brief comment. They are math symbols, some of which you may be familiar with. On the right side -- in the continuous realm -- are \n  \nand (^) dxd , which you'll remember if you've taken calculus. They stand for the two fundamental operations of integration and differentiation. Integration, which can be thought of as finding \"the area under a curve,\" is basically a way of adding up a whole infinite bunch of numbers over some range. When you \"integrate the function x^2 from 3 to 5,\" you're really adding up all the tiny, tiny little vertical slivers that comprise the area from x = 3 on the left to x = 5 on the right. Its corresponding entry in the left-column of the table is S, which is just a short-hand for \"sum up a bunch of things.\" Integration and summation are equivalent operations, it's just that when you integrate, you're adding up all the (infinitely many) slivers across the real-line continuum. When you sum, you're adding up a fixed sequence of entries, one at a time, like in a loop. S is just the discrete \"version\" of  . The same sort of relationship holds between ordinary subtraction (\"-\") and differentiation ( (^) dxd ). If you've plotted a bunch of discrete points on x-y axes, and you want to find the slope between two of them, you just subtract their y values and divide by the (x) distance between them. If you have a smooth continuous function, on the other hand, you use differentiation to find the slope at a point: this is essentially subtracting the tiny tiny difference between two supremely close points and then dividing by the distance between them. Thus subtraction is just the discrete \"version\" of (^) dxd. Don't worry, you don't need to have fully understood any of the integration or differentiation stuff I just talked about, or even to have taken calculus yet. I'm just trying to give you some feel for what \"discrete\" means, and how the dichotomy between discrete and continuous really runs through all of math and computer science. In this book, we will mostly be focusing on discrete values and structures, which turn out to be of more use in computer science. That's partially because as you probably know, computers \n4 CHAPTER 1. MEETUP AT THE TRAILHEAD \nthemselves are discrete, and can only store and compute discrete values. There can be many of them -- megabytes, gigabytes, terabytes -- but each value stored is fundamentally comprised of bits, each of which has a value of either 0 or 1. This is unlike the human brain, by the way, whose neuronal synapses communicate based on the _continuous_ quantities of chemicals present in their axons. So I guess \"computer\" and \"brain\" are another pair of entries we could add to our discrete vs. continuous list. \nThere's another reason, though, why discrete math is of more use to computer scientists than continuous math is, beyond just the bits-and-bytes thing. Simply put, computers operate algorithmically. They carry out programs in step-by-step, iterative fashion. First do this, then do that, then move on to something else. This mechanical execution, like the ticking of a clock, permeates everything the computer can do, and everything we can tell it to do. At a given moment in time, the computer _has_ completed step 7, but _not_ step 8; it has accumulated 38 values, but not yet 39; its database has exactly 15 entries in it, no more and no less; it knows that after accepting this friend request, there will be exactly 553 people in your set of friends. The whole paradigm behind reasoning about computers and their programs is discrete, and that's why we computer scientists find different problems worth thinking about than most of the world did a hundred years ago. \nBut it's still math. It's just _discrete_ math. There's a lot to come, so limber up and let me know when you're ready to hit the road. \n**1.1 Exercises** \nUse an index card or a piece of paper folded lengthwise, and cover up the right-hand column of the exercises below. Read each exercise in the left-hand column, answer it in your mind, then slide the index card down to reveal the answer and see if you're right! For every exercise you missed, figure out why you missed it before moving on. \n 1.1. EXERCISES 5 \n1. What's the opposite     of concrete? \n Abstract. \n2. What's the opposite     of discrete? \n Continuous. \n3. Consider a quantity     of water in a glass.     Would you call it ab-     stract, or concrete?     Discrete, or continu-     ous? \n Concrete, since it's a real entity you can experience with the senses. Continuous, since it could be any number of ounces (or liters, or tablespoons, or whatever). The amount of water certainly doesn't have to be an integer. (Food for thought: since all matter is ultimately comprised of atoms, are even substances like water discrete?) \n4. Consider the number \n27. Would you call it abstract, or concrete? Discrete, or continu- ous? \n Abstract, since you can't see or touch or smell \"twenty-seven.\" Probably discrete, since it's an integer, and when we think of whole numbers we think \"discrete.\" (Food for thought: in real life, how would you know whether I meant the integer \"27\" or the decimal number \"27.0?\" And does it matter?) \n5. Consider a bit in a     computer's memory.     Would you call it ab-     stract, or concrete?     Discrete, or continu-     ous? \n Clearly it's discrete. Abstract vs. concrete, though, is a little tricky. If we're talking about the actual transistor and capacitor that's physically present in the hardware, holding a tiny charge in some little chip, then it's concrete. But if we're talking about the value \"1\" that is conceptually part of the computer's currently executing state, then it's really abstract just like 27 was.

Is this graph weighted? \n No. (No numbers annotating the edges.) \n7. Is it a tree? \n No. (A tree must be connected, and must also have no cycles, which this graph clearly does: e.g. , B-to-A-to-E-to-B.) \n8. Is it a DAG? \n Not remotely: it is neither directed nor acyclic. \n9. If this graph represented an en-     dorelation, how many ordered     pairs would it have? \n14. (If you said 7, remember that since there are no arrowheads on the lines, this is an undirected graph, which corresponds to a symmetric re- lation, and hence both (A, E) and (E, A) will be present.) \n 136 CHAPTER 5. STRUCTURES \n10. How many vertices and edges are     there in the graph below? \n M \n K \n J \n H \n G \n L \n I \n 7 and 10, respectively. \n11. What's the degree of vertex L? It has an in-degree of 2, and an out-degree of 1. \n12. Is this graph directed? Yes. \n13. Is this graph connected? \n Depends on what we mean. There are two different notions of \"connectedness\" for directed graphs. One is strongly connected , which means every vertex is reachable from any other by following the arrows in their specified directions. By that definition, this graph is not connected: there's no way to get to H from J, for example. It is weakly connected , however, which means that if you ignore the arrowheads and consider it like an unidirected graph, it would be connected. \n14. Is it a tree? \n No. For one thing, a tree can't have any \"extra\" edges beyond what's necessary to make it connected, and there's redundancy galore here. \n15. Is it a DAG? \n Allllmost. If you look very carefully, you'll see that there is indeed a cycle: I -to-G-to-L. So if this graph were to represent a recipe or project workflow, it would be impossible to complete. \n16. If we reversed the direction of     the I -to-G edge, would it be     a DAG? \n Yes. The steps could now be completed in this order: H, G, L, I, M, K, and finally J. \n 5.4. EXERCISES 137 \n17. If this graph represented an     endorelation, how many or-     dered pairs would it have? \n 10. \n18. Suppose we traversed the graph     below in depth-first fashion,     starting with node P. In what or-     der would we visit the nodes?        N           O \n P \n R Q \n S \n T \n There are two possible answers: P, Q, R, S, T, N, O, or else P, O, N, T, S, R, Q. (The choice just depends on whether we go \"left\" or \"right\" initially.) Note in particular that either O or Q is at the very end of the list. \n19. Now we traverse the same graph     breadth-first fashion, starting     with node P. Now in what order     would we visit the nodes? \n Again, two possible answers: P, O, Q, N, R, T, S, or else P, Q, O, R, N, S, T. Note in particular that both O and Q are visited very early. \n 138 CHAPTER 5. STRUCTURES \n20. If we traversed the tree below in     pre-order fashion, in what order     would we visit the nodes? \n G \n S \n Y \n H E \n W \n D \n P \n U \n A \n G, S, Y, H, E, W, D, P, U, A. \n21. What if we traversed it in in-     order fashion? H,^ Y,^ E,^ S,^ G,^ D,^ P,^ U,^ W,^ A. \n22. What if we traversed it in post-     order fashion? H,^ E,^ Y,^ S,^ U,^ P,^ D,^ A,^ W,^ G. \n23. Is the graph below a tree? \n Mal \n Jayne \n Inara Kaylee \n Wash \n River \n Simon \n Zoe \n Yes. (Every node has one and only one path to the root, and to every other node for that matter.) \n24. Is it a binary tree? \n Yes. (Every node has at most two children, and they are clearly pictured as being a \"left\" child and/or a \"right\" child.) \n 5.4. EXERCISES 139 \n25. Is it a binary search tree? \n No. Although nearly every node does satisfy the BST property (all the nodes in its left subtree come before it alphabetically, and all the nodes in its right subtree come after it), there is a single exception: Zoe is in Wash's left subtree, whereas she should be to his right. \n26. How could we fix it? \n Many ways; one would be to swap Zoe's and Wash's positions. If we do that, the fixed tree would be: \n Mal \n Jayne \n Inara Kaylee \n Zoe \n River \n Simon \n Wash \n Take a moment and convince yourself that every node of this new tree does in fact satisfy the BST property. \n27. Is the tree balanced? \n It's not too bad, but it does have one too many levels in it (it has a height of 4, whereas all its nodes would fit in a tree of height 3). \n28. How could we make it more bal-     anced? \n Many ways; one would be to rotate the River-Simon-Wash threesome so that Simon becomes Zoe's left child. Simon would then be the parent of River (on his left) and Wash (on his right). \n 140 CHAPTER 5. STRUCTURES \n29. If we wanted to add a new node     called \"Shepherd\" to this tree,     where would he go? \n To Simon's left. \n30. If we wanted to remove the \"Mal\"     node from this tree, how would     we do that? \n We can put the left-most node of Mal's right subtree (that would be River) in Mal's place, and then make Simon (and everything under him) become Wash's left child. The result would look like this: \n River \n Jayne \n Inara Kaylee \n Zoe \n Simon \n Wash \n Take a moment and convince yourself that this Mal-less tree does in fact satisfy the BST property. \n### Chapter 6 \n## Counting \nIf the title of this chapter seems less than inspiring, it's only because the kind of counting we learned as children was mostly of a straightforward kind. In this chapter, we're going to learn to answer some more difficult questions like \"how many different semester schedules could a college student possibly have?\" and \"how many different passwords can a customer choose for this e-commerce website?\" and \"how likely is this network buffer to overflow, given that its packets are addressed to three different destinations?\" \nThe more impressive-sounding name for this topic is **combinatorics**. In combinatorics, we focus on two tasks: counting things (to find out how many there are), and enumerating things (to systematically list them as individuals). Some things turn out to be hard to count but easy to enumerate, and vice versa. \n 141 \n142 CHAPTER 6. COUNTING \n**6.1 The Fundamental Theorem** \nWe start with a basic rule that goes by the audacious name of **The Fundamental Theorem of Counting**.^1 It goes like this: \n If a whole can be divided into k parts, and there's ni choices for the ith^ part, then there's n 1 x n 2 x n 3 x * * * x nk ways of doing the whole thing. \nExample: Jane is ordering a new Lamborghini. She has twelve different paint colors to choose from (including Luscious Red and Sassy Yellow), three different interiors (Premium Leather, Bonded Leather, or Vinyl), and three different stereo systems. She must also choose between automatic and manual transmission, and she can get power locks & windows (or not). How many different configurations does Jane have to choose from? Put another way, how many different kinds of cars could come off the line for her? \nThe key is that every one of her choices is independent of all the others. Choosing an Envious Green exterior doesn't constrain her choice of transmission, stereo, or anything else. So no matter which of the 12 paint colors she chooses, she can independently choose any of the three interiors, and no matter what these first two choices were, she can freely choose any of the stereos, _etc._ It's a mix-andmatch. Therefore the answer is: \n 12 x 3 x 3 x 2 x 2 = 432 choices. \nHere's an alternate notation you'll run into for this, by the way: \n(^1) How many other \"Fundamental Theorems\" of math do you know? Here are a few: the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic says that any natural number can be broken down into its prime factors in only one way. The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra says that the highest power of a polynomial is how many roots (zeroes) it has. The Fundamental Theorem of _Linear_ Algebra says that the row space and the column space of a matrix have the same dimension. The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus says that integration and differentiation are the inverse of each other. \n6.1. THE FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM 143 \n ^ k \n i=1 \n ni \nwhich is just a shorter way of writing \n n 1 x n 2 x n 3 x * * * x nk. \nAs mentioned in section 4.5, the S notation is essentially a loop with a counter, and it says to add up the expression to the right of it for each value of the counter. The P notation is exactly the same, only instead of adding the expressions together for each value of the counter, we're multiplying them. (The reason mathematicians chose the symbols S (sigma) and P (pi) for this, by the way, is that \"sigma\" and \"pi\" start with the same letter as \"sum\" and \"product,\" respectively.) \nWe can actually get a lot of leverage just with the fundamental theorem. How many different PINs are possible for an ATM card? There are four digits, each of which can be any value from 0 to 9 (ten total values), so the answer is: \n 10 x 10 x 10 x 10 = 10, 000 different PINs. \nSo a thief at an ATM machine frantically entering PINs at random (hoping to break your account before you call and stop your debit card) would have to try about 5,000 of them on average before cracking the code. \nWhat about middle school bullies who are trying to break into your locker? Well, most combination locks are opened by a three-number sequence, each number of which is anything from 0 to 39. So there are: \n 40 x 40 x 40 = 64, 000 different combinations. \nThat's probably slightly overstated, since I'll bet consecutive repeat numbers are not allowed (Master probably doesn't manufacture a \n144 CHAPTER 6. COUNTING \nlock with a combination of 17-17-23, for example.) But it does seem at least as secure as a PIN number. \nEvery car in the state of Virginia must be issued its own license plate number. That's a lot of cars. How many different license plate combinations are available? \nThis one requires a bit more thought, since not all licenses numbers have the same number of characters. In addition to \"SED4756\" and \"PXY1927\" you can also have \"DAWG\" or \"LUVME\" or even \"U2\". How can we incorporate these? \nThe trick is to divide up our set into mutually exclusive subsets, and then add up the cardinalities of the subsets. If only 7 characters fit on a license plate, then clearly every license plate number has either 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7 characters. And no license plate has _two_ of these ( _i.e._ , there is no plate that is both 5 characters long _and_ 6 characters long). Therefore they're mutually exclusive subsets, and safe to add. This last point is often not fully appreciated, leading to errors. Be careful not to cavalierly add the cardinalities of nonmutually-exclusive sets! You'll end up double-counting items. \nSo we know that the number of possible license plates is equal to: \n the # of 7-character plates + the # of 6-character plates + the # of 5-character plates + * * * + the # of 1-character plates. \nVery well. We can now figure out each one separately. How do we know how many 7-character plates there are? Well, if every character must be either a letter or a digit, then we have 26 + 10 = 36 choices for each character. This implies 367 different possible 7-character license plates. The total number of plates is therefore: \n 367 + 36^6 + 36^5 + 36^4 + 36^3 + 36^2 + 36 = 80,603,140,212 plates \nwhich is about ten times the population of the earth, so I think we're safe for now. \n6.1. THE FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM 145 \nHere's an interesting thought experiment to test your intuition about numbers. Look at the above calculation, and ask yourself: \"what if the state of Virginia decided, for purposes of consistency, that all license plates _had_ to have the full 7 characters?

If I told you that the bit pattern     1010 was meant to represent a     two's-complement number, what     value would it represent? \n Negative six. The left-most bit is 1, so it's negative. This means in order to figure out the value, we have to flip all the bits and add one. Flipping them yields 0101 , and adding one to that gives 0110 (we had to do one carry). Since the binary number 0110 is positive six, that must mean that what we started with - 1010 - must be negative six. \n### Chapter 8 \n## Logic \nTo a great extent, logic governs the way your mind works, even among so-called \"irrational people.\" If we want to capture logical processes and represent them in a computer program, we need a way to express these thoughts in a form suitable for automated reasoning. This is primarily why computer scientists study logic. \nInterestingly, the material in this chapter covers the very bottom and the very top of the technology stack. At the bottom, we have actual physical hardware that consists of circuits turning bits on and off. The rules that govern when we want to turn which bits on and off are based on \"logic gates,\" or tiny physical devices that implement the logical principles of this chapter on a micro scale. At the other end of the spectrum, we have highly abstract programs aiming towards \"artificial intelligence.\" These systems are centered around a \"knowledge base\" of accumulated facts, and regularly examine those known facts to make decisions and draw additional conclusions. What does a knowledge base consist of? You guessed it: logical statements that are described in this chapter. \n**8.1 Propositional logic** \nThe simpler -- but less powerful -- of the two logic systems we'll study is called **propositional logic**. It has this name because the core building block is the **proposition**. A proposition is simply a \n 197 \n198 CHAPTER 8. LOGIC \nstatement that has a \"truth value,\" which means that it is either true or false. The statement \"all plants are living beings\" could be a proposition, as could \"Barack Obama was the first AfricanAmerican President\" and \"Kim Kardashian will play the title role in _Thor: Love and Thunder_ .\" By contrast, questions like \"are you okay?\" cannot be propositions, nor can commands like \"hurry up and answer already!\" or phrases like \"Lynn's newborn schnauzer,\" because they are not statements that can be true or false. (Linguistically speaking, propositions have to be in the indicative mood.) \nWe normally use capital letters (what else?) to denote propositions, like: \n Let A be the proposition that UMW is in Virginia. Let B be the proposition that the King of England is female. Let C be the proposition that dogs are carnivores. \nDon't forget that a proposition doesn't have to be true in order to be a valid proposition (B is still a proposition, for example). It just matters that it is labeled and that it has the potential to be true or false. \nPropositions are considered **atomic**. This means that they are _indivisible_ : to the logic system itself, or to a computer program, they are simply an opaque chunk of truth (or falsity) called \"A\" or whatever. When we humans read the description of A, we realize that it has to do with the location of a particular institution of higher education, and with the state of the union that it might reside (or not reside) in. All this is invisible to an artificially intelligent agent, however, which treats \"A\" as nothing more than a stand-in label for a statement that has no further discernible structure. \nSo things are pretty boring so far. We can define and label propositions, but none of them have any connections to the others. We change that by introducing **logical operators** (also called **logical connectives** ) with which we can build up compound constructions out of multiple propositions. The six connectives we'll learn are: \n8.1. PROPOSITIONAL LOGIC 199 \n  -- \"and\" ! -- \"not\"  -- \"or\" = -- \"implies\" (or \"if... then... \")  -- \"xor\" (exclusive \"or\") = -- \"equiv\" (equivalent) \nJust as the ordinary algebraic operators (+, -, _etc._ ) can be used to join numbers and produce another number, and just as the set operators can be used to join sets and produce another set, the logical operators can be used to join propositions and produce another proposition. The expression \"34 + 59\" produces the number 93. The expression \"{X,Y}{Y,Z}\" produces the set {X,Y,Z}. And the expression \"A  B\" produces the value false, since although UMW is located in Virginia, the King is not female. \nLet's run through the six operators, some of which are intuitive and some of which are not: \n **(\"and\")** The proposition XY is true when both X and Y are true propositions. \"AC\" represents the proposition \"UMW is in Virginia _and_ dogs are carnivores,\" which has a truth value of true since both components are true. This operation is sometimes called a **conjunction**. Notice that the \"\" sign somewhat resembles the \"\" sign for set intersection. This is not an accident. An element is in the intersection of two sets if it is a member of the first _and_ the second set. Hence mathematicians have chosen symbols which reinforce this connection. \n **(\"or\")** The proposition XY is true when either X or Y (or both) are true propositions. \"BC\" represents the proposition \"The King of England is female _or_ dogs are carnivores,\" which has a truth value of true since the second component is true. This operation is sometimes called a **disjunction**. The  looks somewhat like the \"\" sign for set union, since an element is in the union of two sets if it is an element of the first set _or_ the second set (or both). This operator is sometimes called an \"inclusive or\" since it is true if both propositions are true. \n200 CHAPTER 8. LOGIC \n **(\"xor\")** The  operator is just like  except that it's _exclusive_ : the proposition XY is true when _either_ X _or_ Y (but not both) are true propositions. \"BC\" and \"BC\" are both true, but \"AC\" is false, since UMW is in Virginia _and_ dogs are carnivores. \n! **(\"not\")** This operator is different from the others in that it's _unary_ , which means that it only operates on one proposition instead of two. All it does is flip the value from true to false (or vice versa.) The proposition \"A\" is true, but the proposition \"!A\" is false. \"!B,\" on the other hand, is true. This operation is sometimes called a **negation**. \n= **(\"implies\")** Okay, now for the toughest one. We're going to spend significant time thinking through this one carefully, because it's both important (in some ways, the most important of the operators) and also potentially baffling. I've studied this stuff for years, and I still sometimes get stuck when trying to figure out =. \n If we say \"X=Y,\" we're claiming that \" if X is true, then Y is true.\" Note carefully that we are not claiming that X itself is true. We're simply asserting that if it's true, then Y must necessarily also be true. We call the first part of a = proposition the premise , and the second part the conclusion. Here, X is the premise and Y the conclusion. \n So far, it seems easy. It gets a little slippery when you realize that the only claim \"X=Y\" is making is: \" if X is true, then Y must be true\". If X is not true, then \"X=Y\" is making no claim at all. \n Confusingly enough, this means that except for the one scenario where X is true but Y is false, the statement \"X=Y itself\" is always true. So, besides the obviously sensible case when X and Y are both true, X=Y is true even when: (1) X is false and Y is true, and (2) X is false and Y is false. Or, to put it succinctly: X=Y is true whenever either X is false or Y is true or both. \n8.1. PROPOSITIONAL LOGIC 201 \n For example, A=C is a true proposition, believe it or not. In English, it says \"UMW being in Virginia implies that dogs are carnivores.\" The proposition B=A is also true: \"The King of England being female implies that UMW is in Virginia.\" What possible sense can we make out of these nonsensical claims? \n The key to understanding it, for me at least, is twofold. First, remember that to a computer (or a logic system), there is no meaning to the propositions: they're simply atomic building blocks, each of which is true or false. So the fact that to a human, the content of the propositions might have nothing to do with each other -- English Kings and dogs -- is irrelevant to a computer: it just thinks indifferently in terms of \"X\" and \"Y,\" and has no idea what real-world entities any of this refers to. Second, think in terms of ruling out counterexamples. When I assert X=Y, what I'm saying is \"it's impossible for X to be true and Y false, because X's truthfulness would imply Y's truthfulness.\" Just as when I assert XY I'm promising that either X or Y is true (or both), when I assert X=Y I'm promising that either X is false or Y is true (or both). \n In this way, it starts to make sense when someone says, \"Iowa being in the Southern hemisphere implies that Batman's cape is red.\" That assertion is like a promise: \" if it turns out that Iowa is in the Southern hemisphere, then I guarantee Batman's cape is red.\" But since Iowa isn't in the Southern hemisphere, all bets are off. The conclusion was conditional on the premise. \n The reason this operator is so important is that in artificial intelligence, the name of the game is concluding new facts from known existing facts, so that knowledge is increased. Every time a 'bot learns that X=Y is true, and then also learns that the premise (X) is true, it can conclude that the conclusion (Y) is true, even if it was never explicitly told that Y was true. This rule of logic is called modus ponens , and is the workhorse of automated knowledge bases. \n202 CHAPTER 8. LOGIC \n= **(\"equiv\")** Finally, the proposition X=Y is true whenever X and Y have the same value: they're either both true, or both false. This can be seen as \"implies in both directions,\" since X=Y means \"if X is true, then Y is true; and if Y is true, then X is true.\" This operator is also the inverse of , since XY is true only if X and Y are different, and X=Y is true only if they're the same. \nThese operators, which each produce another proposition (called a **compound proposition** ) from the proposition(s) they operate on, can be combined to form complex expressions.

That's a rather extreme example, but we can see how it applies to the roommate example as well. The roommates share a respect for the history that shapes the visiting friend's behavior, operating on the implicit assumption that it's worth tolerating some of the friend's less-thanideal qualities in recognition of that history. This reveals some of the group's deeper beliefs A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 50 \n about the reciprocal nature of friendship and the importance of mutual support. You likely believe in those ideals, too, but your initial argument wasn't effective because it didn't recognize that those beliefs were in play. For Longaker and Walker, \"Presuppositions determine not only what the speaker means and what the audience understands; they also determine both the speaker's and the audience's understanding of the occasion\" (14). Now that you understand what's really at issue regarding the visiting friend's behavior, you're in a much better position to make arguments that resonate with the presuppositions you all share about friendship. In the quote above, Longaker and Walker say that the speaker and audience become a \"community\" when they're engaging with arguments based on shared beliefs. It turns out that we're all members of beliefs-based communities and that we're shifting between these groups all the time in our day-to-day lives. Think about the way you might change your language, tone, or references as you switch between friend groups or social situations. You wouldn't use the same inside jokes that you formed with your college friends with your friends from high school because they wouldn't make sense. It also takes a little time to gain a keen sense of the underlying values in a friend group, as we saw with the roommate example. Some of those same principles apply to our interactions with social, political, professional, or cultural communities we belong to. Rhetoricians use the term discourse community to refer to a group that uses a shared language to work toward mutual goals and operate on shared values. Discourse communities are usually organized around a specific purpose or philosophy, and they establish patterns and conventions for communication to work toward their goals. Academic disciplines, activist groups, athletic teams, and religious groups all count as discourse communities, since they all have their own patterns of communication that help them achieve concrete outcomes as a group. The idea of shared language is crucial to understanding what makes a discourse community tick. Imagine stumbling into an advanced biochemistry class when you'd never even taken an introductory chemistry course or walking into a busy restaurant kitchen and hearing the chef shout orders to the kitchen staff. You'd have no idea what anyone was talking about! That's because, as composition scholar Dan Melzer points out, discourse communities use \"specialized terms,\" which linguist John Swales has also called \"lexis,\" to communicate as specifically as possible about the concepts that matter to their community (102). Those specialized terms allow discourse communities to advance their knowledge and communicate in concrete ways as they work to solve problems, from ensuring consistency in a restaurant kitchen to producing reliable results in a biochemistry lab. At this point, you might be tempted to say, \"Oh, cool, so that means pretty much everything is a discourse community if it uses language to solve problems. My friends and I make up a discourse community when we're discussing the problem of whether to get Taco Bell or Jack in the Box.\" Well, not quite. A discourse community needs to have consistent, traceable goals that are at least somewhat publicly oriented so that potential members can see what the group is all about and how communication contributes to those goals. A private group chat between housemates probably wouldn't count as a discourse community, but a subreddit devoted to discussion of the game Animal Crossing would. In order to count as a discourse community, a group needs to arrive at patterns that render its communication legible to people outside the community as well. A housemates' group chat might have shared goals of setting chores \n#### DISCOURSE COMMUNITIES \n 51 COLLECTED WORKS \n or making plans, but it's not designed to communicate those goals to anyone beyond your housemates. An Animal Crossing subreddit, while focused on the relatively loose goal of enjoying a video game, must establish rules and patterns that make it possible for newcomers to see how and why the community functions. Any discourse community, regardless of its purpose, needs to use language consistently enough for anyone to be able to join, even if there is a learning curve in understanding all the patterns, terms, and expectations. In a discourse community, language functions as a system, a durable set of tools that anyone should be able to pick up and use. Dan Melzer emphasizes the centrality of genre in discourse communities, showing how the shared characteristics of genres help create predictable and accessible patterns of communication that make a group's goals easier to achieve. You might think about a lab report as a genre in the discourse community of biochemistry: lab reports contain concrete conventions that allow experimenters to secure reliable results. Similarly, posts to the Animal Crossing subreddit need to follow the community rules to ensure that communication remains on topic, appropriate, and aligned with the broader goals of the discourse community. As Melzer points out, \"Genres arise out of social purposes, and they're a form of social action within discourse communities\" (103-104). From Animal Crossing to biochem, members of a discourse community need consistent language to meet their goals. This is ultimately why rhetoricians care about discourse communities: because they show us how people use language as a system to share ideas and get things done. So we understand that it's important to get a well-rounded sense of an issue and determine what values are at play before we try to intervene with an argument. We also understand that we need consistent discursive tools to help us understand and pursue shared goals. One set of tools at our disposal is the stasis questions , a simple series of four questions that can help you identify where disagreement rests on a particular issue. The idea of \"stasis\" refers to that area of disagreement, where a given group can't yet move forward in consensus on how they'd answer the question at hand. The following are the different types of stasis questions:  Questions of fact: Does X exist?  Questions of definition: What is X? How does X differ from Y?  Questions of evaluation: Is X good? What are its causes/effects?  Questions of policy: What should we do about X? These look pretty simple, right? They are! Yet they can yield some really complex insights about a particular discourse community's beliefs--and the answers to the same set of stasis questions can have completely different answers, depending on what discourse community you're asking. Take climate change, for example. In some political contexts, there are still disagreements about whether climate change even exists or what causes it. For the scientists who believe in the data about the existence of climate change, discussions have moved into the policy realm to consider how we can combat the impacts of climate change. So while some politicians are still at the level of stasis on whether climate change is a fact, climate scientists are deliberating at the level of policy. \n#### STASIS QUESTIONS \n A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 52 \nYou can also use the stasis questions to brainstorm the inquiries that are important to be able to answer in a given topic. They can help you take stock and figure out what aspect of an issue demands further analysis. Let's say you're considering writing an essay about homelessness in your area but you're not sure where to start. You might brainstorm a set of questions such as this:  _Questions of fact:_ Does homelessness exist in my community? How many homeless people are there in this city? How many of them are children?  _Questions of definition:_ Does one simply have to lack an address to be homeless? What about couch surfing or living in a car?  _Questions of evaluation:_ What impacts does homelessness have on people's ability to find stable employment? What conditions lead to homelessness?  _Questions of policy:_ How can we combat homelessness in this community? How can we help homeless people find jobs? You might notice that the stasis questions increase in levels of complexity: you must know the answer to the first question to proceed to the next. If you don't understand the basic facts of an issue, you can't make an informed argument about it. You'd need to consider the impacts and effects of homelessness before you make an argument about how to fix it. This brings us back to Krista Ratcliffe's rhetorical listening: while it's very tempting to jump into a new context or encounter a new problem by immediately proposing a solution, you must first take the time to immerse yourself in the existing conversations, contexts, and complexities before trying to make a judgment call. We saw how well it went in the roommate example when the new roommate tried to take a stance on an issue they didn't fully understand. So when in doubt, remember this tip: _Listen before you argue._ 53 COLLECTED WORKS \n**1.** What can you do to better understand the context of an argument or     position in (a) a conversation with someone you know or (b) an article or     something else you are reading? \n**2.** Are there instances in which you might try to make an argument to     someone who doesn't share your presuppositions?

No longer was this franchise about men enacting postapocalyptic violence; now, there was an important place in that universe for women. A similar phenomenon surrounded Wonder Woman in 2017: after dozens of male-fronted superhero movies, one would finally focus on a female hero exclusively. Some people, though, were resistant to this reading of feminism in film. I found myself in regular debates after each of these releases about what it meant to promote gender equality in film: Does substituting a violent woman for a violent man constitute feminism? Is the leading woman in a film a feminist just by virtue of being in a female-fronted film? Or do her political beliefs take priority? Does the presence of women on the screen preclude the fact that those women are still highly sexualized? These questions, debates, and discussions gesture toward the interpretive process. Indeed, most arguments (verbal or written) rely on the fact that we each process texts and information from different positions with different purposes, lenses, and preoccupations. Why is it that some people leave the theater after Mad Max or Wonder Woman feeling empowered and others leave deeply troubled? Interpretation is a complex process that is unique to every reader. It is a process of meaning making that relies on your particular position as a reader. Your interpretive position is informed by several factors: In the same way you have a rhetorical purpose in writing, you often have a purpose in reading, either consciously or subconsciously. What are you trying to accomplish in this encounter with a text? \n#### INTERPRETATION \n##### 1.

But what we _can_ say about an O(n) algorithm is that if you double the number of nodes, you're going to approximately double the running time. If you quadruple the number of nodes, you're going to quadruple the running time. This is what you'd expect. \n128 CHAPTER 5. STRUCTURES \nSearching for \"Molly\" in a simple unsorted list of names is an O(n) prospect. If there's a thousand nodes in the list, on average you'll find Molly after scanning through 500 of them. (You might get lucky and find Molly at the beginning, but then of course you might get really unlucky and not find her until the end. This averages out to about half the size of the list in the normal case.) If there's a _million_ nodes, however, it'll take you 500,000 traversals on average before finding Molly. Ten times as many nodes means ten times as long to find Molly, and a thousand times as many means a thousand times as long. Bummer. \nLooking up Molly in a BST, however, is an O(lg n) process. Recall that \"lg\" means the logarithm (base-2). This means that doubling the number of nodes gives you a _miniscule_ increase in the running time. Suppose there were a thousand nodes in your tree, as above. You wouldn't have to look through 500 to find Molly: you'd only have to look through _ten_ (because lg(1000)  10 ). Now increase it to a million nodes. You wouldn't have to look through 500,000 to find Molly: you'd only have to look through _twenty_. Suppose you had 6 billion nodes in your tree (approximately the population of the earth). You wouldn't have to look through 3 billion nodes: you'd only have to look through _thirty-three_. Absolutely mindboggling. \n**Adding nodes to a BST** \nFinding things in a BST is lightning fast. Turns out, so is adding things to it. Suppose we acquire a new customer named Jennifer, and we need to add her to our BST so we can retrieve her account information in the future. All we do is follow the same process we would if we were _looking_ for Jennifer, but as soon as we find the spot where she would be, we add her there. In this case, Jennifer comes before Mitch (go left), and before Jessica (go left again), and after Ben (go right). Ben has no right child, so we put Jessica in the tree right at that point. (See Figure 5.26.) \nThis adding process is also an O(lg n) algorithm, since we only need look at a small number of nodes equal to the height of the tree. \nNote that a new entry always becomes a _leaf_ when added. In fact, \n5.2. TREES 129 \n Mitch \n Jessica \n Ben Jim \n Randi \n Owen \n Molly \n Xander \n Mitch \n Jessica \n Ben \n Jennifer \n Jim \n Randi \n Owen \n Molly \n Xander \n Figure 5.26: The BST after adding Jennifer. \nthis allows us to look at the tree and reconstruct some of what came before. For instance, we know that Mitch must have been the first node originally inserted, and that Randi was inserted before Owen, Xander, or Molly. As an exercise, add your own name to this tree (and a few of your friends' names) to make sure you get the hang of it. When you're done the tree must of course obey the BST property. \n**Removing nodes from a BST** \nRemoving nodes is a bit trickier than adding them. How do we delete an entry without messing up the structure of the tree? It's easy to see how to delete Molly: since she's just a leaf, just remove her and be done with it. But how to delete Jessica? Or for that matter, Mitch? \nYour first inclination might be to eliminate the node and promote one of its children to go up in its place. For instance, if we delete Jessica, you might think we could just elevate Ben up to where Jessica was, and then move Jennifer up under Ben as well. This doesn't work, though. The result would look like Figure 5.27, with Jennifer in the wrong place. The next time we look for Jennifer in the tree, we'll search to the _right_ of Ben (as we should), completely \n130 CHAPTER 5. STRUCTURES \nmissing her. Jennifer has effectively been lost. \n Mitch \n Jessica \n Ben \n Jennifer \n Jim \n Randi \n Owen \n Molly \n Xander \n#### ! \n Mitch \n Ben \n Jennifer Jim \n Randi \n Owen \n Molly \n Xander \nFigure 5.27: A **wrong** (non)-BST after removing Jessica incorrectly. \nOne correct way (there are others) to do a node removal is to replace the node with _the left-most descendant of its right subtree_. (Or, equivalently, the right-most descendant of its left subtree). Let's be careful to define this: to get the left-most descendant of a node's right subtree, we (1) go to the _right_ child of the node, and then (2) go as-left-as-we-possibly-can from there, until we come to a node that has no left child. That node (the one without a left child) is officially the left-most descendent of the original node's right subtree. \nExample: flip back to Figure 5.17 (p. 117). What is the left-most descendent of G's right subtree? Answer: A. We start by going right from G down to H, and then we go as-left-as-possible...which turns out to be only one node's worth of \"left,\" because we hit A, and A has no left child (or right child, for that matter.) Work these additional examples out for yourself: what is the left-most descendent of K's right subtree? Of D's? Of H's?^5 \nOkay, let's return to Figure 5.26 (p. 129) and remove Jessica the _correct_ way. We simply find the left-most descendent of her right \n(^5) Answers: The left-most descendent of K's right subtree is **C** , of D's right subtree is **O** , and of H's, **F**. \n5.2. TREES 131 \nsubtree - namely, Jim - and promote him in place of her. Figure 5.28 shows the result. Note that we replaced her with Jim _not_ because it's okay to blindly promote her right child, but because _Jim had no left descendants_ , and hence he was the left-most node in her right subtree. (If he _had_ left descendents, promoting him would have been just as wrong as promoting Ben. Instead, we would have gone left from Jim until we couldn't go left anymore, and promoted _that_ node.) \n Mitch \n Jessica \n Ben \n Jennifer \n Jim \n Randi \n Owen \n Molly \n Xander \n Mitch \n Jim \n Ben \n Jennifer \n Randi \n Owen \n Molly \n Xander \n Figure 5.28: The BST after removing Jessica correctly. \nAs another example, let's go whole-hog and remove the root node, Mitch. The result is as shown in Figure 5.29. It's rags-to-riches for Molly: she got promoted from a leaf all the way to the top. Why Molly? Because she was the left-most descendant of Mitch's right subtree. \nTo see why this works, just consider that _Molly was immediately after Mitch in alphabetical order._ The fact that he was a king and she a peasant was misleading. The two of them were actually very close: consecutive, in fact, with in-order traversal. So replacing Mitch with Molly avoids shuffling anybody out of alphabetical order, and preserves the all-important BST property. \n132 CHAPTER 5. STRUCTURES \n Mitch \n Jim \n Ben \n Jennifer \n Randi \n Owen \n Molly \n Xander \n Molly \n Jim \n Ben \n Jennifer \n Randi \n Owen Xander \n Figure 5.29: The BST after removing Mitch. \n**Balancedness** \nFinally, recall that this amazingly fast lookup is critically dependent on the tree being \"bushy.\" Otherwise, the approximation that h = lg(l) breaks down. As a laughably extreme example, consider Figure 5.30, which contains the same nodes we've been using. This is a legitimate binary search tree! (Check it!) Yet looking up a node in this monstrosity is obviously not going to be any faster than looking it up in a plain-old list. We're back to O(n) performance. \nIn practice, there are three ways of dealing with this. One approach is to simply not worry about it. After all, as long as we're inserting and removing nodes randomly, with no discernable pattern, the chances of obtaining a tree as lopsided as Figure 5.30 are astronomically small. It's as likely as throwing a deck of cards up in the air and having it land all in a neat stack. The law of entropy tells us that we're going to get a mix of short branches and long branches, and that in a large tree, the unbalancedness will be minimal. \nA second approach is to periodically rebalance the tree. If our website goes offline for maintenance every once in a while anyway, we could rebuild our tree from the ground up by inserting the nodes \n5.2. TREES 133 \n Ben \n Jennifer \n Jim \n Molly \n Owen \n Randi \n Xander \n Figure 5.30: An incredibly bad, but still technically legit, BST. \ninto a fresh tree in a beneficial order. What order should we insert them in? Well, remember that whichever node is inserted first will be the root. This suggests that we'd want to insert the _middle_ node first into our tree, so that Molly becomes the new root. This leaves half the nodes for her left subtree and half for her right. If you follow this process logically (and recursively) you'll realize that we'd next want to insert the middle nodes _of each half._ This would equate to Jennifer and Randi (in either order). I think of it like the markings on a ruler: first you insert half an inch, then 1 4 and^ \n 3 4 inches, then^ \n 1 8 ,^ \n 3 8 ,^ \n 5 8 , and^ \n7 8 inches,^ _etc._^ This restores to us a perfectly balanced tree at regular intervals, making any large imbalances even more improbable (and short-lived). \n134 CHAPTER 5. STRUCTURES \nThirdly, there are specialized data structures you may learn about in future courses, such as AVL trees and red-black trees, which are binary search trees that add extra rules to prevent imbalancing. Basically, the idea is that when a node is inserted (or removed), certain metrics are checked to make sure that the change didn't cause too great an imbalance. If it did, the tree is adjusted so as to minimize the imbalance. This comes at a slight cost every time the tree is changed, but prevents any possibility of a lopsided tree that would cause slow lookups in the long run. \n**5.3 Final word** \nWhew, that was a lot of information about structures. Before we continue our walk in the next chapter with a completely different topic, I'll leave you with this summary thought. Let BST be the set of Binary Search Trees, and BT be the set of Binary Trees. Let RT be the set of rooted trees, and T be the set of trees (free or rooted). Finally, let CG be the set of connected graphs, and G the set of all graphs. Then we have: \n BST  BT  RT  T  CG  G. \nIt's a beautiful thing. \n 5.4. EXERCISES 135 \n**5.4 Exercises** \n1.

The answer is yes, since both 2 and 4 are also members of Q. \nNotice that by the definition, every set is a subset of itself. Sometimes, though, it's useful to talk about whether a set is really a _sub_ set of another, and you don't want it to \"count\" if the two sets are actually equal. This is called a **proper subset** , and the symbol for it is . You can see the rationale for the choice of symbol, because \"\" is kind of like \"<=\" for numbers, and \"\" is like \"<\". \nEvery set is a subset (not necessarily a proper one) of ohm, because \n24 CHAPTER 2. SETS \nour domain of discourse by definition contains everything that can come up in conversation. Somewhat less obviously, the empty set is a subset of every set. It's weird to think that   Q when Q has several things in it, but the definition does hold. \"Every\" member of  (there are none) is in fact also a member of Q. \nOne note about reading this notation that I found confusing at first. Sometimes the expression \"a  X\" is pronounced \"a is an element of X,\" but other times it is read \"a, _which is_ an element of X\". This may seem like a subtle point, and I guess it is, but if you're not ready for it it can be a extra stumbling block to understanding the math (which is the last thing we need). Take this hypothetical (but quite typical) excerpt from a mathematical proof: \n \"Suppose k  N < 10... \" \nIf you read this as \"Suppose k _is_ a natural number _is_ less than 10,\" it's ungrammatical. It really should be understood as \"Suppose k (which is a natural number) is less than 10.\" This is sometimes true of additional clauses as well. For instance, the phrase \"Suppose k  R > 0 is the x-coordinate of the first point\" should be read \"Suppose k, _which is a real number greater than zero_ , is the xcoordinate of the first point.\" \nI'll leave you with a statement about numbers worth pondering and understanding: \n   N  Z  Q  R  ohm. \n**2.11 Power sets** \n**Power set** is a curious name for a simple concept. We talk about the power set \"of\" another set, which is _the set of all subsets of that other set._ Example: suppose A = { Dad, Lizzy }. Then the power set of A, which is written as \"P(A)\" is: { { Dad, Lizzy }, { Dad }, { Lizzy },  }. Take a good look at all those curly braces, and \n2.11. POWER SETS 25 \ndon't lose any. There are four elements to the power set of A, each of which is one of the possible subsets. It might seem strange to talk about \" _all_ of the possible subsets\" -- when I first learned this stuff, I remember thinking at first that there would be no limit to the number of subsets you could make from a set. But of course there is. To create a subset, you can either include, or exclude, each one of the original set's members. In A's case, you can either (1) include both Dad and Lizzy, or (2) include Dad but not Lizzy, or (3) include Lizzy but not Dad, or (4) exclude both, in which case your subset is . Therefore, P(A) includes all four of those subsets. \nNow what's the cardinality of P(X) for some set X? That's an interesting question, and one well worth pondering. The answer ripples through the heart of a lot of combinatorics and the binary number system, topics we'll cover later. And the answer is right at our fingertips, if we just extrapolate from the previous example. To form a subset of X, we have a choice to either _in_ clude, or else _ex_ clude, each of its elements. So there's two choices for the first element^4 , and then whether we choose to include or exclude that first element, there are two choices for the second. Regardless of what we choose for those first two, there are two choices for the third, _etc._ So if |X| = 2 (recall that this notation means \"X has two elements\" or \"X has a cardinality of 2\"), then its power set has 2 x 2 members. If |X| = 3, then its power set has 2 x 2 x 2 members. In general: \n |P(X)| = 2|X|. \nAs a limiting case (and a brain-bender) notice that if X is the empty set, then P(X) has _one_ (not zero) members, because there is in fact _one_ subset of the empty set: namely, the empty set itself. So |X| = 0, and |P(X)| = 1. And that jives with the above formula. \n(^4) I know there's really no \"first\" element, but work with me here. \n26 CHAPTER 2. SETS \n**2.12 Partitions** \nFinally, there's a special variation on the subset concept called a **partition**. A partition is a group of subsets of another set that together are both **collectively exhaustive** and **mutually exclusive**. This means that every element of the original set is in _one and only one_ of the sets in the partition. Formally, a partition of X is a group of sets X 1 , X 2 ,... , Xn such that: \n X 1  X 2  * * *  Xn = X, \nand \n Xi  Xj =  for all i, j. \nSo let's say we've got a group of subsets that are supposedly a partition of X. The first line, above, says that if we combine the contents of all of them, we get everything that's in X (and nothing more). This is called being collectively exhaustive. The second line says that no two of the sets have anything in common: they are mutually exclusive. \nAs usual, an example is worth a thousand words. Suppose the set D is { Dad, Mom, Lizzy, T.J., Johnny. } A partition is any way of dividing D up into subsets that meet the above conditions. One such partition is: \n { Lizzy, T.J. }, { Mom, Dad }, and { Johnny }. \nAnother one is: \n { Lizzy }, { T.J. }, { Mom }, and { Johnny, Dad }. \nYet another is: \n , , { Lizzy, T.J., Johnny, Mom, Dad }, and . \n2.12. PARTITIONS 27 \nAll of these are ways of dividing up the Davies family into groups so that no one is in more than one group, and everyone is in some group. The following is _not_ a partition: \n { Mom, Lizzy, T.J. }, and { Dad } \nbecause it leaves out Johnny. This, too, is _not_ a partition: \n { Dad }, { Mom, T.J. }, and { Johnny, Lizzy, Dad } \nbecause Dad appears in two of the subsets. \nBy the way, realize that every set (S) together with its (total) complement (S) forms a partition of the entire domain of discourse ohm. This is because every element either is, or is not, in any given set. The set of males and non-males are a partition of ohm because everything is either a male or a non-male, and never both (inanimate objects and other nouns are non-males, just as women are). The set of prime numbers and the set of everything-except-prime-numbers are a partition. The set of underdone cheeseburgers and the set of everything-except-underdone-cheeseburgers form a partition of ohm. By pure logic, this is true no matter what the set is. \nYou might wonder why partitions are an important concept. The answer is that they come up quite a bit, and when they do, we can make some important simplifications. Take S, the set of all students at UMW. We can partition it in several different ways. If we divide S into the set of freshmen, sophomores, juniors, and seniors, we have a partition: every student is one of those grade levels, and no student is more than one.^5 If we group them into in-state and out-of-state students, we again have a partition. And if we divide them into those who live on-campus and those who live off, we again have a partition. \nNote that dividing S into computer science majors and English majors does _not_ give us a partition. For one thing, not everyone is majoring in one of those two subjects. For another, some students \n(^5) Apologies to fifth-year (or sixth-year, or...) \"super seniors.\" \n28 CHAPTER 2. SETS \nmight be double-majoring in both. Hence this group of subsets is neither mutually exclusive nor collectively exhaustive. It's interesting to think about gender and partitions: when I grew up, I was taught that males and females were a partition of the human race. But now I've come to realize that there are non-binary persons who do not identify with either of those genders, and so it's not a partition after all. \nQuestion: is the number of students |S| equal to the number of off-campus students plus the number of on-campus students? Obviously yes. But why? The answer: because the off-campus and on-campus students form a partition. If we added up the number of freshmen, sophomores, juniors, and seniors, we would also get |S|. But adding up the number of computer science majors and English majors would almost certainly _not_ be equal to |S|, because some students would be double-counted and others counted not at all. This is an example of the kind of beautiful simplicity that partitions provide. \n 2.13.

Read each exercise in the left-hand column, answer it in your mind, then slide the index card down to reveal the answer and see if you're right! For every exercise you missed, figure out why you missed it before moving on. \n1. Is the set { Will, Smith }     the same as the set { Smith,     Will }? \n Yes indeed. \n2. Is the ordered pair (Will,     Smith) the same as (Smith,     Will)? \n No. Order matters with ordered pairs (hence the name), and with any size tuple for that matter. \n3. Is the set { { Luke, Leia },     Han } the same as the set     { Luke, { Leia, Han } }? \n No. For instance, the first set has Han as a member but the second set does not. (Instead, it has another set as a member, and that inner set happens to include Han.) \n4. What's the first element of     the set { Cowboys, Redskins,     Steelers }? \n The question doesn't make sense. There is no \"first element\" of a set. All three teams are equally members of the set, and could be listed in any order. \n5.

Is J  G? \n No. \n6. Is J  S?     Yes. \n7. Is Yoda  J? \n Yes. \n 30 CHAPTER 2. SETS \n8. Is Yoda  J? \n No. Yoda isn't even a set, so it can't be a subset of anything. \n9. Is { Yoda }  J? \n Yes. The (unnamed) set that contains only Yoda is in fact a subset of J. \n10. Is { Yoda }  J? \n No. Yoda is one of the elements of J, but { Yoda } is not. In other words, J contains Yoda, but J does not contain a set which contains Yoda (nor does it contain any sets at all, in fact). \n11. Is S  J? \n No. \n12. Is G  F?     Yes, since the two sets are equal. \n13. Is G  F? \n No, since the two sets are equal, so neither is a proper subset of the other. \n14. Is   S? \n Yes, since the empty set is a subset of every set. \n15. Is   ? \n Yes, since the empty set is a subset of every set. \n16. Is F  ohm?     Yes, since every set is a subset of ohm. \n17. Is F  ohm? \n Yes, since every set is a subset of ohm, and F is certainly not equal to ohm. \n18. Suppose X = { Q, , { Z }     }. Is   X? Is   X? \n Yes and yes. The empty set is an element of X because it's one of the elements, and it's also a subset of X because it's a subset of every set. Hmmm. \n19.

A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 80 \n###### CHAPTER 10. \n## ARISTOTELIAN AND ROGERIAN ARGUMENTATION \n###### SHANE ABRAMS; LIZ DELF; ROB DRUMMOND; AND KRISTY KELLY \n To a nonconfrontational person, argument is a dirty word. It surfaces connotations of raised voices, slammed doors, and dominance; it arouses feelings of anxiety and frustration. But argument is not inherently bad. In fact, as a number of great thinkers have described, conflict is necessary for growth, progress, and community cohesion. Through disagreement, we challenge our commonsense assumptions and seek compromise. The negative connotations surrounding \"argument\" actually point to a failure in the way that we argue. Now spend a few minutes reflecting on the last time you had an argument with a loved one. What was it about? What was it really about? What made it difficult? What made it easy? Often, arguments hinge on the relationship between the arguers: whether written or verbal, that argument will rely on the specific language, approach, and evidence that each party deems valid. For that reason, the most important element of the rhetorical situation is audience. Making an honest, impactful, and reasonable connection with that audience is the first step to arguing better. Unlike the argument with your loved one, it is likely that your essay will be establishing a brand-new relationship with your reader, one that is untouched by your personal history, unspoken bonds, or other assumptions about your intent. This clean slate is a double-edged sword: although you'll have a fresh start, you must more deliberately anticipate and navigate your assumptions about the audience. What can you assume your reader already knows and believes? What kind of ideas will they be most swayed by? What life experiences have they had that inform their world view? \"But I just want to write an unbiased essay.\" Let's address a common concern that students raise when writing about controversial issues: neutrality. It's quite likely that you've been trained, at some point in your writing career, to avoid bias, to be objective, to be impartial. However, this is a habit you need to unlearn, because every text is biased by virtue of being rhetorical. All rhetoric has a purpose, whether declared or secret, and therefore is partial. \n#### IMPARTIAL VERSUS MULTIPARTIAL \n 81 A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT \n Instead of being impartial, I encourage you to be multipartial. In other words, you should aim to inhabit many different positions in your argument--not zero, not one, but many. This is an important distinction: no longer is your goal to be unbiased; rather, it is to be balanced. You will provide your audience not with a neutral perspective but rather with a perspective conscientious of the many other perspectives out there. In the study of argumentation, scholars and authors have developed a great variety of approaches: when it comes to convincing, there are many different paths that lead to our destination. For the sake of succinctness, we will focus on two: the Aristotelian argument and the Rogerian argument. While these two are not opposites, they are built on different values. Each will employ rhetorical appeals like those discussed in chapter 6, but their purposes and guiding beliefs are different. \n##### Aristotelian Argument \n In Ancient Greece, debate was a cornerstone of social life. Intellectuals and philosophers devoted hours upon hours of each day to honing their argumentative skills. For one group of thinkers, the Sophists, the focus of argumentation was to find a distinctly \"right\" or \"wrong\" position. The more convincing argument was the right one: the content mattered less than the technique by which it was delivered. In turn, the purpose of an Aristotelian argument is to persuade someone (the other debater and/ or the audience) that the speaker was correct. Aristotelian arguments are designed to bring the audience from one point of view to the other. Therefore, an Aristotelian arguer tries to demonstrate the validity of their direction while addressing counterarguments: \"Here's what I believe and why I'm right; here's what you believe and why it's wrong.\" The author seeks to persuade their audience through the sheer virtue of their truth. \n##### Rogerian Argument \n In contrast, Rogerian arguments are more invested in compromise. Based on the work of psychologist Carl Rogers, Rogerian arguments are designed to enhance the connection between both sides of an issue. This kind of argument acknowledges the value of disagreement in material communities to make moral, political, and practical decisions. Often, a Rogerian argument will begin with a fair statement of someone else's position and consideration of how that could be true. In other words, a Rogerian arguer addresses their \"opponent\" more like a teammate: \"What you think is not unreasonable; I disagree, but I can see how you're thinking, and I appreciate it.\" Notice that by taking the other ideas on their own terms, you demonstrate respect and cultivate trust and listening. The rhetorical purpose of a Rogerian argument, then, is to come to a conclusion by negotiating common ground between moral-intellectual differences. Instead of debunking an opponent's counterargument entirely, a Rogerian arguer would say, \"Here's what each of us thinks, and here's what we have in common. How can we proceed forward to honor our shared beliefs but find a new, informed position?\" \n#### COMMON FORMS OF ARGUMENTATION \n A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 82 \n Examples of Aristotelian and Rogerian arguments re: appropriate winter gear. \n##### Position Aristotelian Rogerian \n##### Wool \n##### sweaters \n##### are the \n##### best \n##### clothing \n##### for cold \n##### weather. \n Wool sweaters are the best clothing for cold weather because they are fashionable and comfortable. Some people might think that wool sweaters are itchy, but those claims are ill-informed. Wool sweaters can be silky smooth if properly handled in the laundry. Some people might think that wool sweaters are itchy, which can certainly be the case. I've worn plenty of itchy wool sweaters. But wool sweaters can be silky smooth if properly handled in the laundry; therefore, they are the best clothing for cold weather. If you want to be cozy and in style, consider my laundry techniques and a fuzzy wool sweater. Neither form is necessarily better, but rather both are useful in specific contexts.

While this version of argumentation deals with everything from ethics to arrangement, what this field adds to rhetorical studies is a new approach to argument fallacies. Fallacies are often the cause of the mystery feeling we get when we come across faulty logic or missteps in an argument. What follows is an adaptation of Frans van Eemeren, Rob Grootendorst, and Francesca Snoeck Henkemans's \"violations of the rules for critical engagement\" from their book Argumentation: Analysis, Evaluation, Presentation (109). Rather than discuss rhetorical fallacies in a list (ad hominem, straw man, equivocation, etc.), they argue that there should be rules for proper argument to ensure fairness, logic, and a solution to the problem being addressed. Violating these rules causes a fallacious argument and can result in a standoff rather than a solution. While fallacious arguments, if purposeful, pose real ethical problems, most people do not realize they are committing fallacies when they create an argument. To purposely attack someone's character rather than their argument (ad hominem) not only is unethical but demonstrates lazy argumentation. However, confusing cause and effect might simply be a misstep that needs fixing. It is important to admit that many fallacies, though making an argument somewhat unsound, can be rhetorically savvy. While we know that appeals to pity (or going overboard on the emotional appeal) can often demonstrate a lack of knowledge or evidence, they often work. As such, these rules present argumentation as it would play out in a utopian world where everyone is calm and logical, where everyone cares about resolving the argument at hand rather than winning the battle, and where everyone plays by the rules. Despite the utopian nature of the list, it offers valuable insight into argument flaws and offers hope for better methods of deliberation. 85 A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT \n There are many ways to stop an individual from giving her own argument. This can come in the form of a physical threat but most often takes the form of a misplaced critique. Instead of focusing on the argument, the focus is shifted to the character of the writer or speaker (ad hominem) or to making the argument (or author) seem absurd (straw man) rather than addressing its actual components. In the past decade, \"Bush is stupid\" became a common ad hominem attack that allowed policy to go unaddressed. To steer clear of the real issues of global warming, someone might claim, \"Only a fool would believe global warming is real\" or \"Trying to suck all of the CO2 out of the atmosphere with giant greenhouse gas machines is mere science fiction, so we should look at abandoning all this greenhouse gas nonsense.\" This is one of my favorites. It is clear and simple. If you make an argument, you have to provide evidence to back it up. During the 2008 presidential debates, Americans watched as all the candidates fumbled over the following question about health care: \"How will this plan actually work?\" If you are presenting a written argument, this requirement can be accommodated through quality, researched evidence applied to your standpoint.

For example, one person might argue that the rhetoric of global warming has created a multimillion-dollar green industry benefiting from fears over climate change. This is an argument about the effects of global warming rhetoric, not global warming itself. It would break the standpoint rule to argue that the writer/ speaker does not believe in global warming. This is not the issue at hand. Similar to #3, this rule assures that the evidence you use must actually relate to your standpoint. Let's stick with the same argument: global warming has created a green industry benefiting from fears over climate change. Under this rule, your evidence would need to offer examples of the rhetoric and the resulting businesses that have developed since the introduction of green industries. It would break the rules to simply offer attacks on businesses that sell \"eco-friendly\" products. This one sounds a bit complex, though it happens nearly every day. If you have been talking to another person and feel the need to say, \"That's not what I meant,\" then you have experienced a violation of the unexpressed premise rule. Overall, the rule attempts to keep the argument on track and not let it stray into irrelevant territory. The first violation of the rule, to falsely present what has been left unexpressed, is to rephrase someone's standpoint in a way that redirects the argument. One person might argue, \"I love to go to the beach,\" and another might respond by saying, \"So you don't have any appreciation for mountain living.\" The other aspect of this rule is to camouflage an unpopular idea and deny that it is part of your argument.

Although we have not achieved parity in access to technology worldwide, information has never been easier to uncover. This is, of course, a double-edged sword: the proliferation of ideas due to the technological revolution enables new kinds of learning but also has fundamentally changed the way we think and interact. One of my friends refers to his iPhone as the \"Wonder Killer\": because he has such quick access to answers through the miniature computer he carries everywhere, the experience of sustained curiosity is now very rare in his life. All kinds of questions are easily answered by googling \"Who was that guy in Back to the Future Part II ?\" or \"Do spiders hibernate?\" or by taking a brief crawl through Wikipedia: \"How has globalization impacted Bhutan's economy?\" \"What life experiences influenced Frida Kahlo's painting?\" But the answers to these questions, though easily discovered, paint a very one-dimensional portrait of human knowledge. For scientists and writers alike, the spirit of curiosity motivates at once individual learning and also the growth and progress of our collective knowledge. Your innate ability to be curious puts you in the league of the most brilliant and prolific scholars--people who were driven by questions, seeking to interrogate the world around them. In this section, I add my voice to the chorus of writing teachers whose rallying cry is a renewed investment in curiosity. Hopefully, you too will embrace inquisitive fascination by rejecting easy answers and using writing as a means of discovery. It's possible that you've already written research papers by this point in your academic career. If your experience has been like mine, writing these papers went one of two ways: \n**1.** The teacher assigns a specific topic for you to research, and sometimes even a     specific thesis for you to prove. \n**2.** The teacher provides more freedom, allowing students to choose a topic at     their own discretion or from a set of options. \n#### INQUIRY-BASED RESEARCH \n 143 A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT \n In both situations, my teacher expected me to figure out what I wanted to argue, then find research to back me up. I was expected to have a fully formed stance on an issue, then use my sources to explain and support that stance. Not until graduate school did I encounter inquirybased research, which inverts this sequence. Put simply, inquiry-based research refers to research and research writing that is motivated by curiosity rather than a teacher's requirement. A Comparison of Research Styles Table 19.1 A chart comparing inquiry and non-inquiry-based research \n##### Non-inquiry-based research Inquiry-based research \nYour research begins with an answer and seeks out evidence that confirms that answer. Your research begins with a question, reviews all the evidence available, and then develops that answer. For example, a murder occurs, and I get a bad vibe from the butler. I look for all the clues that confirm that the butler did it; assuming I find what I need, I can declare that the butler did it. For example, a murder occurs. I look for as many clues as I can, then determine the most likely culprit based on that evidence. It's quite possible that the butler did do it, and both logical processes might lead me to the same conclusion. However, an inquiry-based investigation allows more consideration for the possibility that the butler is innocent. Consider the difference this can make: if research is about **learning** , then an inquiry-based perspective is essential. If you only seek out the ideas that agree with you, you will never learn. Even in the event that the investigation yields the same answers, their differences are crucial. When we only look for answers that agree with our preexisting ideas, we are more likely to ignore other important ideas, voices, and possibilities. Most importantly, **confirmation bias** inhibits genuine learning, which relies on challenging, expanding, and complicating our current knowledge and world views. Consequently, inquiry-based research is time-consuming and intensive: instead of only dealing with evidence that supports a certain answer or perspective, it requires the reasoner to encounter a great diversity of evidence and answers, which can be difficult to sift through. This distinction has important implications for the kind of research and research writing for which this book advocates.  You don't have to--shouldn't, in fact--have a thesis set in stone before starting your thesis, but you must be tremendously flexible: be prepared to pivot, qualify, nuance, or entirely change your answer as you proceed.  In order to pursue your research question, you will need to encounter _a lot_ of sources. Not all of the sources you encounter will make it into your paper, which is a new practice for some students. This is a time-consuming process, but it leads to more significant learning, more complex thinking, and more interesting and effective rhetoric. A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 144 \n Finding a conversation that you're excited about and genuinely interested in is the first and most important step. As you develop a topic, keep in mind that pursuing your curiosities and passions will make your research process less arduous, more relevant, and more pleasant. Such an approach will also naturally improve the quality of your writing: the interest you have for a topic will come across in the construction of your sentences and your willingness to pursue multiple lines of thought about a topic. An author's boredom results in a boring paper, and an author's enthusiasm translates to enthusiastic writing. Depending on the parameters your teacher has set, your research topic might need to (1) present a specific viewpoint, (2) focus on a specific topic, or (3) focus on a certain theme or set of ideas. It's also possible that your teacher will allow complete autonomy for one or all of your research assignments. Be sure you review any materials your instructor provides and ask clarifying questions to make sure your topic fits the guidelines of their assignment. To generate ideas, identify areas of interest, then develop questions of all sizes and types. Eventually, you will zero in on a question or combination of questions as your path of inquiry. What makes for a good research question or path of inquiry? Of course, the answer to this question will depend on your rhetorical situation. However, there are some common characteristics of a good research question in any situation: Engaging and fruitful research questions require complex, informed answers. However, they shouldn't be so subjective, intricate, or expansive that they simply cannot be answered in the scope of your rhetorical situation. By establishing parameters on your scope, you can be sure your research is directed and relevant. Research questions and the rhetoric they inform are valuable only because they have stakes: even if it's a small demographic, the answers to your research question should impact someone. As discussed earlier in this chapter, inquiry-based research should encourage you to articulate a unique standpoint by synthesizing many different voices, interpreted from your individual perspective, with your life experiences and ideas. What you say doesn't have to be groundbreaking, but it shouldn't just reiterate ideas, arguments, histories, or perspectives. \n#### DEVELOPING A RESEARCH QUESTION \n##### 1. It is answerable but not easily answerable. \n##### 2. It is specific. \n##### 3. It matters to someone. \n##### 4. It allows you to say something new or unique. \n 145 COLLECTED WORKS \n It is difficult to find a question that hits all these marks on your first try. As you proceed through research, prewriting, drafting, and revising, you should refine and adjust your question(s). Just like any other part of writing, developing a path of inquiry is iterative: you've got to take a lot of chances and work your way toward different results. In order to find the best version of your research question, you should develop \"working questions\"--questions of all sizes and types that are pertinent to your subject. As you can see below, you can start with a handful of simple working questions that will eventually lead to a viable research question. Revising Simple Questions into Research Questions Table 19.2 Chart showing the steps of revising a research question from working question to research question \n##### Beginning \n##### interest \n##### Working question \n##### Working research \n##### question \n##### Revised research question \n##### Vietnamese \n##### food and \n##### culture \n What do people eat in Vietnam?

More complex answers, higher stakes, very specific \n##### Health \n Are people in the United States more obese than they used to be? Too straightforward, not specific enough Have obesity rates increased in the United States over the last one hundred years? More specific Is there a correlation between obesity rates and economic instability in the United States over the last one hundred years? More complex answers, higher stakes, very specific \n##### World \n##### religion \n What is the role of religion in the Middle East? Not specific enough, difficult to answer in depth How has religion influenced politics in the Middle East in the last fifty years? More specific, easier to answer How has religion's influence on government impacted the day-to-day lives of Qatari citizens? Very specific, higher stakes, more complex answers As you hone your path of inquiry, you may need to zoom in or out in terms of scope: depending on your rhetorical situation, you will need different degrees of focus. Just like narration, research writing benefits from a careful consideration of scope. Often, a narrower scope is easier to work with than a broader scope--you will be able to write more and write better if your question asks for more complex thinking. It's important to be flexible throughout your research project. Be prepared to pivot topics, adjust your research question, change your opinions, and confront unanticipated challenges. As you build a working knowledge of your topic, you might complicate or narrow your working questions.

Heavy lines indicate edges that have been (irrevocably) added to the set. \n5.2. TREES 111 \nyou think that the shortest path between any two nodes would land right on this Prim network? Yet if you compare Figure 5.14 with Figure 5.13 you'll see that the quickest way from Bordeaux to Strasbourg is through Marseille, not Vichy. \nSo we end up with the remarkable fact that the shortest route between two points has nothing whatsoever to do with the shortest _total_ distance between _all_ points. Who knew? \n**5.2 Trees** \nA tree is really nothing but a simplification of a graph. There are two kinds of trees in the world: free trees, and rooted trees.^4 \n**Free trees** \nA **free tree** is just a connected graph with no cycles. Every node is reachable from the others, and there's only one way to get anywhere. Take a look at Figure 5.15. It looks just like a graph (and it is) but unlike the WWII France graph, it's more skeletal. This is because in some sense, a free tree doesn't contain anything \"extra.\" \nIf you have a free tree, the following interesting facts are true: \n1. There's exactly one path between any two nodes. (Check it!) \n2. If you remove any edge, the graph becomes disconnected.     (Try it!) \n3. If you add any new edge, you end up adding a cycle. (Try it!) \n4. If there are n nodes, there are n - 1 edges. (Think about it!) \nSo basically, if your goal is connecting all the nodes, and you have a free tree, you're all set. Adding anything is redundant, and taking away anything breaks it. \n(^4) There appears to be no consensus as to which of these concepts is the most basic. Some authors refer to a free tree simply as a \"tree\" -- as though this were the \"normal\" kind of tree -- and use the term rooted tree for the other kind. Other authors do the opposite. To avoid confusion, I'll try to always use the full term (although I admit I'm one who considers rooted trees to be the more important, default concept). \n112 CHAPTER 5. STRUCTURES \n C \n B D \n E \n A \n F \n Figure 5.15: A free tree. \nIf this reminds you of Prim's algorithm, it should. Prim's algorithm produced exactly this: a _free tree_ connecting all the nodes -- and specifically the free tree with shortest possible total length. Go back and look at the final frame of Figure 5.14 and convince yourself that the darkened edges form a free tree. \nFor this reason, the algorithm is often called **Prim's minimal spanning tree algorithm**. A \"spanning tree\" just means \"a free tree that spans (connects) all the graph's nodes.\" \nKeep in mind that there are many free trees one can make with the same set of vertices. For instance, if you remove the edge from A to F, and add one from anything else to F, you have a different free tree. \n**Rooted trees** \nNow a **rooted tree** is the same thing as a free tree, except that we elevate one node to become the **root**. It turns out this makes all the difference. Suppose we chose A as the root of Figure 5.15. Then we would have the rooted tree in the left half of Figure 5.16. The A vertex has been positioned at the top, and everything else is flowing under it. I think of it as reaching into the free tree, carefully grasping a node, and then lifting up your hand so the rest of the free tree dangles from there. Had we chosen (say) C as the root \n5.2. TREES 113 \ninstead, we would have a different rooted tree, depicted in the right half of the figure. Both of these rooted trees have all the same edges as the free tree did: B is connected to both A and C, F is connected only to A, _etc._ The only difference is which node is designated the root. \n A \n F B \n C \n D E \n C \n B \n A \n F \n D E \nFigure 5.16: Two different rooted trees with the same vertices and edges. \nUp to now we've said that the spatial positioning on graphs is irrelevant. But this changes a bit with rooted trees. Vertical positioning is our only way of showing which nodes are \"above\" others, and the word \"above\" does indeed have meaning here: it means closer to the root. The altitude of a node shows how many steps it is away from the root. In the right rooted tree, nodes B, D, and E are all one step away from the root (C), while node F is three steps away. \nThe key aspect to rooted trees -- which is both their greatest advantage and greatest limitation -- is that _every node has one and only one path to the root._ This behavior is inherited from free trees: as we noted, every node has only one path to every other. \nTrees have a myriad of applications. Think of the files and folders on your hard drive: at the top is the root of the filesystem (perhaps \"/\" on Linux/Mac or \"C:\\\\\" on Windows) and underneath that are named folders. Each folder can contain files as well as other named folders, and so on down the hierarchy. The result is that each file has one, and only one, distinct path to it from the top of the filesystem. The file can be stored, and later retrieved, in exactly one way. \n114 CHAPTER 5. STRUCTURES \nAn \"org chart\" is like this: the CEO is at the top, then underneath her are the VP's, the Directors, the Managers, and finally the rankand-file employees. So is a military organization: the Commander in Chief directs generals, who command colonels, who command majors, who command captains, who command lieutenants, who command sergeants, who command privates. \nThe human body is even a rooted tree of sorts: it contains skeletal, cardiovascular, digestive, and other systems, each of which is comprised of organs, then tissues, then cells, molecules, and atoms. In fact, anything that has this sort of part-whole containment hierarchy is just asking to be represented as a tree. \nIn computer programming, the applications are too numerous to name. Compilers scan code and build a \"parse tree\" of its underlying meaning. HTML is a way of structuring plain text into a tree-like hierarchy of displayable elements. AI chess programs build trees representing their possible future moves and their opponent's probable responses, in order to \"see many moves ahead\" and evaluate their best options. Object-oriented designs involve \"inheritance hierarchies\" of classes, each one specialized from a specific other. _Etc._ Other than a simple sequence (like an array), trees are probably the most common data structure in all of computer science. \n**Rooted tree terminology** \nRooted trees carry with them a number of terms. I'll use the tree on the left side of Figure 5.16 as an illustration of each: \n**root.** The node at the top of the tree, which is A in our example. Note that unlike trees in the real world, computer science trees have their root at the top and grow down. Every tree has a root except the **empty tree** , which is the \"tree\" that has no nodes at all in it.

It would break the standpoint rule to argue that the writer/ speaker does not believe in global warming. This is not the issue at hand. Similar to #3, this rule assures that the evidence you use must actually relate to your standpoint. Let's stick with the same argument: global warming has created a green industry benefiting from fears over climate change. Under this rule, your evidence would need to offer examples of the rhetoric and the resulting businesses that have developed since the introduction of green industries. It would break the rules to simply offer attacks on businesses that sell \"eco-friendly\" products. This one sounds a bit complex, though it happens nearly every day. If you have been talking to another person and feel the need to say, \"That's not what I meant,\" then you have experienced a violation of the unexpressed premise rule. Overall, the rule attempts to keep the argument on track and not let it stray into irrelevant territory. The first violation of the rule, to falsely present what has been left unexpressed, is to rephrase someone's standpoint in a way that redirects the argument. One person might argue, \"I love to go to the beach,\" and another might respond by saying, \"So you don't have any appreciation for mountain living.\" The other aspect of this rule is to camouflage an unpopular idea and deny that it is part of your argument. For example, you might argue, \"I have nothing against my neighbors. I just think that there should be a noise ordinance in this part of town to help cut down on crime.\" This clearly shows that the writer does believe her neighbors to be criminals but won't admit it. \n#### IV. THE RELEVANCE RULE \n A PARTY MAY DEFEND HIS OR HER STANDPOINT ONLY BY ADVANCING ARGUMENTATION RELATED TO THAT STANDPOINT. \n# \" \n (van Eemeren et al. 119) \n#### V. THE UNEXPRESSED PREMISE RULE \n A PARTY MAY NOT FALSELY PRESENT SOMETHING AS A PREMISE THAT HAS BEEN LEFT UNEXPRESSED BY THE OTHER PARTY OR DENY A PREMISE THAT HE OR SHE HAS LEFT IMPLICIT. \n# \" \n (van Eemeren et al. 121) 87 COLLECTED WORKS \n Part of quality argumentation is to agree on the opening standpoint. According to this theory, argument is pointless without this kind of agreement. It is well known that arguing about abortion is nearly pointless as long as one side is arguing about the rights of the unborn and the other about the rights of women. These are two different starting points. This rule is about argument strategy. Argument schemes could take up another paper altogether. Suffice it to say that schemes are ways of approaching an argument, your primary strategy. For example, you might choose emotional rather than logical appeals to present your position. This rule highlights the fact that some argument strategies are simply better than others. For example, if you choose to create an argument based largely on attacking the character of your opponent rather than the issues at hand, the argument is moot. Argument by analogy is a popular and well-worn argument strategy (or scheme). Essentially, you compare your position to a more commonly known one and make your argument through the comparison. For example, in the \"Trust No One\" argument in chapter 9, the author equates the Watergate and Monica Lewinsky scandals. Since it is common knowledge that Watergate was a serious scandal, including Monica Lewinsky in the list offers a strong argument by analogy: the Lewinsky scandal did as much damage as Watergate. To break this rule, you might make an analogy that does not hold up, such as comparing a minor scandal involving a local school board to Watergate. This would be an exaggeration, in most cases. \n#### VI. THE STARTING POINT RULE \n NO PARTY MAY FALSELY PRESENT A PREMISE AS AN ACCEPTED STARTING POINT, OR DENY A PREMISE REPRESENTING AN ACCEPTED STARTING POINT. \n# \" \n (van Eemeren et al. 128) \n#### VII. THE ARGUMENT SCHEME RULE \n A STANDPOINT MAY NOT BE REGARDED AS CONCLUSIVELY DEFENDED IF THE DEFENSE DOES NOT TAKE PLACE BY MEANS OF AN APPROPRIATE ARGUMENT SCHEME THAT IS CORRECTLY APPLIED. \n# \" \n (van Eemeren et al. 130) A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 88 \n This rule is about traditional logics. Violating this rule means that the parts of your argument do not match up. For example, your cause and effect might be off: If you swim in the ocean today, you will get stung by a jellyfish and need medical care. Joe went to the doctor today. He must have been stung by a jellyfish. While this example is obvious (we do not know that Joe went swimming), many argument problems are caused by violating this rule. This seems the most obvious rule, yet it is one that most public arguments ignore. If your argument does not cut it, admit the faults and move on. If another writer/speaker offers a rebuttal and you clearly counter it, admit that the original argument is sound. Seems simple, but it's not in our public culture. This would mean that George W. Bush would have to have a press conference and say, \"My apologies, I was wrong about WMD,\" or for someone who argued fervently that Americans want a single-payer option for health care to instead argue something like, \"The polls show that Americans want to change health care, but not through the singlepayer option. My argument was based on my opinion that the single-payer option is the best way and not on public opinion.\" Academics are more accustomed to retraction because our arguments are explicitly part of particular conversations. Rebuttals and renegotiations are the norm. That does not make them any easier to stomach in an \"argument is war\" culture. \n#### VIII. THE VALIDITY RULE \n THE REASONING IN THE ARGUMENTATION MUST BE LOGICALLY VALID OR MUST BE CAPABLE OF BEING MADE VALID BY MAKING EXPLICIT ONE OR MORE UNEXPRESSED PREMISES. \n# \" \n (van Eemeren et al. 132) \n#### IX. THE CLOSURE RULE \n A FAILED DEFENSE OF A STANDPOINT MUST RESULT IN THE PROTAGONIST RETRACTING THE STANDPOINT, AND A SUCCESSFUL DEFENSE OF A STANDPOINT MUST RESULT IN THE ANTAGONIST RETRACTING HIS OR HER DOUBTS. \n# \" \n (van Eemeren et al. 134) 89 COLLECTED WORKS \n While academics are perhaps the worst violators of this rule, it is an important one to discuss. Be clear. I notice in both student and professional academic writing that a confusing concept often means confusing prose, longer sentences, and more letters in a word. If you cannot say it / write it clearly, the concept might not yet be clear to you. Keep working. Ethical violations of this rule happen when someone is purposefully ambiguous so as to confuse the issue. We can see this on all the \"law\" shows on television or through deliberate propaganda.

What's the problem with violating     these rules? \n**2.** Why is it helpful to identify and learn names for these rules?

THE USAGE RULE \n PARTIES MUST NOT USE ANY FORMULATIONS THAT ARE INSUFFICIENTLY CLEAR OR CONFUSINGLY AMBIGUOUS, AND THEY MUST INTERPRET THE FORMULATIONS OF THE OTHER PARTY AS CAREFULLY AND ACCURATELY AS POSSIBLE. \n# \" \n (van Eemeren et al. 136) \n#### DISCUSSION QUESTIONS \n A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 90 \n**1.** These rules are examples of what not to do--but of course people still do     them. Find an example of someone (a politician, a TikTok influencer, a     journalist) willfully or unintentionally violating one of these rules. Discuss     what they did and how it impacted their argument. \n**2.** Find a print ad or short commercial on the internet that violates one of     these rules. How so? Why do they do this? Is it effective? Is it manipulative? \n**3.** Choose one of the \"rules\" that are established in this chapter:      Write a short argument (one to two sentences) about your        next paper topic that clearly violates the rule. This can be a        poorly framed version of your own argument, or it could        be a real (but fallacious) argument that other people make        about the issue.      Explain why this argument violates the rule. Why might        someone do this in an argument? Would it be effective? (To        be clear, these fallacies are examples of what not to        do--but, of course, people still use them.)      Take the fallacious argument that you just created and        correct it: write a solid argument that conforms to the        rule. van Eemeren, Frans H., Rob Grootendorst, and Francesca Snoeck Henkemans. _Argumentation: Analysis, Evaluation, Presentation_.

They struggle to let go of certain assumptions about how an academic paper should be. Some students who have mastered that form, and enjoyed a lot of success from doing so, assume that college writing is simply more of the same. The skills that go into a very basic kind of essay--often called the five-paragraph theme--are indispensable. If you're good at the five-paragraph theme, then you're good at identifying a clearfl and consistent thesis, arranging cohesive paragraphs, organizing evidence for key points, and situating an argument within a broader context through the intro and conclusion. In college you need to build on those essential skills. The five-paragraph theme, as such, is bland and formulaic; it doesn't compel deep thinking. Your instructors are looking for a more ambitious and arguable thesis, a nuanced and compelling argument, and real-life evidence for all key points, all in an organically structured paper. Figures 12.1 and 12.2 contrast the standard five-paragraph theme and the organic college paper. The five-paragraph theme (outlined in figure 12.1) is probably what you're used to: the introductory paragraph starts broad and gradually narrows to a thesis, which readers expect to find at the very end of that paragraph. In this idealized format, the thesis invokes the magic number of three: three reasons why a statement is true. Each of those reasons is explained and justified in the three body paragraphs, and then the final paragraph restates the thesis before gradually getting broader. This format is easy for readers to follow, and it helps writers organize their points and the evidence that goes with them. That's why you learned this format. \n#### MOVING BEYOND THE FIVE-PARAGRAPH THEME \n A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 92 \n_Fig 12.1 The five-paragraph \"theme\"_ In contrast, figure 12.2 represents a paper on the same topic that has the more organic form expected in college. The first key difference is the thesis. Rather than simply positing a number of reasons to think that something is true, it puts forward an arguable statement: one with which a reasonable person might disagree. An arguable thesis gives the paper purpose. It surprises readers and draws them in. You hope your reader thinks, \"Huh. Why would they come to that conclusion?\" and then feels compelled to read on. The body paragraphs, then, build on one another to carry out this ambitious argument. In the classic five-paragraph theme (figure 12.1), it hardly matters which of the three reasons you explain first or second. In the more organic structure (figure 12.2), each paragraph specifically leads to the next. The last key difference is seen in the conclusion. Because the organic essay is driven by an ambitious, nonobvious argument, the reader comes to the concluding section thinking, \"OK, I'm convinced by the argument. What do you, author, make of it? Why does it matter?\" The conclusion of an organically structured paper has a real job to do. It doesn't just reiterate the thesis; it explains why the thesis matters. 93 COLLECTED WORKS \n Fig 12.2 The organic college paper The substantial time you spent mastering the five-paragraph form in figure 12.1 was time well spent; it's hard to imagine anyone succeeding with the more organic form without the organizational skills and habits of mind inherent in the simpler form. (And it is worth noting that there are limited moments in college where the five-paragraph structure is still useful--inclass essay exams, for example.) But if you assume that you must adhere rigidly to the simpler form, you're blunting your intellectual ambition. Your instructors will not be impressed by obvious theses, loosely related body paragraphs, and repetitive conclusions. They want you to undertake an ambitious independent analysis, one that will yield a thesis that is somewhat surprising and challenging to explain.

Very specific, higher stakes, more complex answers As you hone your path of inquiry, you may need to zoom in or out in terms of scope: depending on your rhetorical situation, you will need different degrees of focus. Just like narration, research writing benefits from a careful consideration of scope. Often, a narrower scope is easier to work with than a broader scope--you will be able to write more and write better if your question asks for more complex thinking. It's important to be flexible throughout your research project. Be prepared to pivot topics, adjust your research question, change your opinions, and confront unanticipated challenges. As you build a working knowledge of your topic, you might complicate or narrow your working questions. Gradually, try to articulate a research question (or combination of questions). Remember to be flexible as you research though: you might need to pivot, adjust, refocus, or replace your research question as you learn more. Consider this imaginary case study as an example of this process: Ahmed began his project by identifying the following areas of interest: racism in the US, technology in medicine and health care, and independent filmmaking. After doing some freewriting and preliminary research on each, he decided he wanted to learn more about racially motivated police violence. He developed working questions: \n#### WORKING QUESTIONS \n A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 146 \n Are police officers likely to make judgments about citizens based on their race?  Have police forces instituted policies to avoid racism?  Who is most vulnerable to police violence?  Why does it seem like police officers target people of color? Who is responsible for overseeing the police? He realized that he needed to narrow his focus to develop a more viable path of inquiry, eventually ending up with the following research question:  Over the last thirty years, what populations are most likely to experience police violence in the US? However, after completing more research, Ahmed discovered that his answers came pretty readily: young Black men are significantly more vulnerable to be victims of police violence. He realized that he was not really saying anything new, so he had to tweak his path of inquiry. Ahmed did some more freewriting and dug around to find a source that disagreed with him or added a new layer to his answers. He discovered eventually that there are a handful of police organizations that have made genuine efforts to confront racism in their practices. Despite the widespread and normalized violence enacted against people of color, these groups were working against racial violence. He reoriented his research question to be the following:  Have antiracist police trainings and strategies been effective in reducing individual or institutional racism over the last thirty years?

Create a catalog of topics you are personally curious     about--things that you want to learn more about. These don't have to be     revolutionary things right away; it's more important that they're     meaningful to you.        **a.** First, choose three of the following broad topic           headings: politics, science and technology, food, sports,           music and art, other cultures and nations, social justice,           the environment and sustainability, health and disease,           business and economy, education. On your first sheet           of a three-column paper, write those three topic           headings. **b.** Next, underneath each topic heading, write bulleted lists of as many subtopics or related ideas that come to mind that interest you. (Try not to censor yourself here--the idea is to generate a large number of bullet points. To some extent, this is an exercise in free association: What are the first things that come to mind when you think of each topic?) Spend ten to fifteen minutes on your lists.        **c.** Read over your lists, making note especially of items           that surprised you. Choose the three items from the           full page that most interest you. You can choose one           from each column, three from the same, or any           combination of lists, so long as you have three items           that you care about. \n**2.** Idea generation: Internet stumbling.

After stumbling, review the list you've made of potentially interesting topics. Are you already familiar with any of them? Which surprised you? Are there any relationships or intersections worth exploring further? From these topics and subtopics, try to articulate a viable and interesting research question that speaks to your curiosity. \n**3.** Moving from topics to questions: Small group activity.

Then rotate your papers another step--repeat until you have your original sheet of paper back.        **c.** Review the questions your groupmates compiled on           your sheet. Have they offered anything that surprises           you--issues you haven't thought of, relationships           between questions, recurring themes or patterns of           interest, or foci that might yield interesting answers? \n**4.** Moving from topics to questions: Whole class gallery walk.

Such consternation! Educators are fond of research papers because they require you to find your own sources, confront conflicting evidence, and synthesize diverse information and ideas--all skills required in any professional leadership role. Research papers also allow students to pursue their own topic of interest; your professors have to assume that you are genuinely interested in at least some major part of the course. The open-endedness of research papers sets you up to do your best work as a self-motivated scholar. This chapter is about secondary sources: what they are, where to find them, and how to choose them. For example, let's think about the distinction between primary and secondary sources. Primary sources are original documents, data, or images: the law code of the Le Dynasty in Vietnam, the letters of Kurt Vonnegut, data gathered from an experiment on color perception, an interview, or Farm Service Administration photographs from the 1930s. Secondary sources are produced by analyzing primary sources. They include news articles, scholarly articles, reviews of films or art exhibitions, documentary films, and other pieces that have some descriptive or analytical purpose. Some things may be primary sources in one context but secondary sources in another. For example, if you're using news articles to inform an analysis of a historical event, they're serving as secondary sources. If you're counting the number of times a particular newspaper reported on different types of events, then the news articles are serving as primary sources because they're more akin to raw data. You've probably heard by now that if you cite Wikipedia as an authoritative source, the wrath of your instructor shall be visited upon you. Why is it that even the most informative Wikipedia articles are still often considered illegitimate? And what are good sources to use? The table below summarizes the types of secondary sources in four tiers. All sources have their legitimate uses, but the top-tier ones are preferable for citation in an academic context. \n#### AH, THE RESEARCH PAPER \n#### SOME SOURCES ARE BETTER THAN OTHERS \n A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 154 \n Table 20.1 Analyzing the quality of secondary sources \n##### Tier Type Content Uses How to find them \n##### Tier \n##### I \n Peer-reviewed academic publications Rigorous research and analysis Provide strong evidence for claims and references to other high-quality sources Google Scholar, library catalogs, and academic article databases \n##### Tier \n##### II \n Reports, articles, and books from credible nonacademic sources Well-researched and even-handed descriptions of an event or state of the world Initial research on events or trends not yet analyzed in the academic literature; may reference important Tier 1 sources Websites of relevant agencies, Google searches using *.gov or *.org sites, academic article databases \n##### Tier \n##### III \n Short pieces from newspapers or credible websites Simple reporting of events, research findings, or policy changes Often point to useful Tier 2 or Tier 1 sources; may provide a factoid or two not found anywhere else Strategic Google searches or article databases, including newspapers and magazines \n##### Tier \n##### IV \n Agenda-driven or uncertain pieces Mostly opinion, varying in thoughtfulness and credibility May represent a particular position within a debate; more often provide keywords and clues about higher-quality sources Nonspecific Google </passage>"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<tool_call>\\n{\"arguments\": {\"queries\": [\"Based on the information provided, what can be inferred about Ahmed's initial research question?\", 'What logical inferences can be made about young Black men being significantly more vulnerable to police violence?', 'What conclusions can be drawn about the effectiveness of antiracist police trainings and strategies in reducing racism?'], \"name\": \"ExpertQAExtractor\"}}\\n</tool_call>"}]}

Take a closer look, and you'll discover that most of these are pretty thick, dense volumes packed with lots of equations and proofs. They're principled approaches, written by mathematicians and (seemingly) to mathematicians. I speak with complete frankness when I say I'm comforted to know that the human race is well covered in this area. We need smart people who can derive complex expressions and prove theorems from scratch, and I'm glad we have them. \nYour average computer science practitioner, however, might be better served by a different approach. There are elements to the discrete math mindset that a budding software developer needs experience with. This is why discrete math is (properly, I believe) part of the mandatory curriculum for most computer science undergraduate programs. But for future programmers and engineers, the emphasis should be different than it is for mathematicians and researchers in computing theory. A practical computer scientist mostly needs to be able to _use_ these tools, not to _derive_ them. She needs familiarity, and practice, with the fundamental concepts and the thought processes they involve. The number of times the average software developer will need to construct a proof in graph theory is probably near zero. But the times she'll find it useful to reason about probability, logic, or the properties of collections are frequent. \nI believe the majority of computer science students benefit most from simply gaining an appreciation for the richness and rigor of \n iii \niv PREFACE \nthis material, what it means, and how it impacts their discipline. Becoming an expert theorem prover is not required, nor is deriving closed-form expressions for the sizes of trees with esoteric properties. Basic fluency with each topic area, and an intuition about when it can be applied, is the proper aim for most of those who would go forward and build tomorrow's technology. \nTo this end, the book in your hands is a quick guided tour of introductory-level discrete mathematics. It's like a cool, brisk walk through a pretty forest. I point out the notable features of the landscape and try to instill a sense of appreciation and even of awe. I want the reader to get a feel for the lay of the land, and a little exercise. If the student acquires the requisite vocabulary, gets some practice playing with the toys, and learns to start thinking in terms of the concepts here described, I will count it as a success. \n## Acknowledgements \nA hearty thanks to Karen Anewalt, Crystal Burson, Prafulla Giri, Tayyar Hussain, Jennifer Magee, Veena Ravishankar, Jacob Shtabnoy, and a decade's worth of awesome UMW Computer Science students for their many suggestions and corrections to make this text better! \n v \n### Chapter 1 \n## Meetup at the trailhead \nBefore we set out on our \"cool, brisk walk,\" let's get oriented. What _is_ discrete mathematics, anyway? Why is it called that? What does it encompass? And what is it good for? \nLet's take the two words of the subject, in reverse order. First, _math_. When most people hear \"math,\" they think \"numbers.\" After all, isn't math the study of quantity? And isn't that the class where we first learned to count, add, and multiply? \nMathematics certainly has its root in the study of numbers -- specifically, the \"natural numbers\" (the integers from 1 on up) that fascinated the ancient Greeks. Yet math is broader than this, almost to the point where numbers can be considered a special case of something deeper. In this book, when we talk about trees, sets, or formal logic, there might not be a number in sight. \nMath is about **abstract, conceptual objects that have properties, and the implications of those properties.** An \"object\" can be any kind of \"thought material\" that we can define and reason about precisely. Much of math deals with questions like, \"suppose we defined a certain kind of thing that had certain attributes. What would be the implications of this, if we reasoned it all the way out?\" The \"thing\" may or may not be numerical, whatever it turns out to be. Like a number, however, it will be crisply defined, have certain known aspects to it, and be capable of combining with other things in some way. \n 1 \n2 CHAPTER 1. MEETUP AT THE TRAILHEAD \nFundamental to math is that it deals with the _abstract_. Abstract, which is the opposite of concrete, essentially means something that can't be perceived with the senses. A computer chip is concrete: you can touch it, you can see it. A number is not; nor is a function, a binary tree, or a logical implication. The only way to perceive these things is with the power of the mind. We will write expressions and draw pictures of many of our mathematical structures in order to help visualize them, and nearly everything we study will have practical applications whereby the abstractness gets grounded in concreteness for some useful purpose. But the underlying mathematical entity remains abstract and ethereal -- only accessible to the mind's eye. We may use a pencil to form the figure \"5\" on a piece of paper, but that is only a concrete manifestation of the underlying concept of \"five-ness.\" Don't mistake the picture or the symbol for the thing itself, which always transcends any mere physical representation. \nThe other word in the name of our subject is \"discrete\" (not to be confused with \"discreet,\" which means something else entirely). The best way to appreciate what discrete means is to contrast it with its opposite, continuous. Consider the following list: \n Discrete Continuous whole numbers (Z) real numbers (R) int double digital analog quantum continuum counting measuring number theory analysis S \n  \n- (^) dxd What do the left-hand entries have in common? They describe things that are measured in crisp, distinct intervals, rather than varying smoothly over a range. Discrete things jump suddenly from position to position, with rigid precision. If you're 5 feet tall, you might some day grow to 5.3 feet; but though there might be 5 \n 3 \npeople in your family, there will never be 5.3 of them (although there could be 6 someday). \nThe last couple of entries on this list are worth a brief comment. They are math symbols, some of which you may be familiar with. On the right side -- in the continuous realm -- are \n  \nand (^) dxd , which you'll remember if you've taken calculus. They stand for the two fundamental operations of integration and differentiation. Integration, which can be thought of as finding \"the area under a curve,\" is basically a way of adding up a whole infinite bunch of numbers over some range. When you \"integrate the function x^2 from 3 to 5,\" you're really adding up all the tiny, tiny little vertical slivers that comprise the area from x = 3 on the left to x = 5 on the right. Its corresponding entry in the left-column of the table is S, which is just a short-hand for \"sum up a bunch of things.\" Integration and summation are equivalent operations, it's just that when you integrate, you're adding up all the (infinitely many) slivers across the real-line continuum. When you sum, you're adding up a fixed sequence of entries, one at a time, like in a loop. S is just the discrete \"version\" of  . The same sort of relationship holds between ordinary subtraction (\"-\") and differentiation ( (^) dxd ). If you've plotted a bunch of discrete points on x-y axes, and you want to find the slope between two of them, you just subtract their y values and divide by the (x) distance between them. If you have a smooth continuous function, on the other hand, you use differentiation to find the slope at a point: this is essentially subtracting the tiny tiny difference between two supremely close points and then dividing by the distance between them. Thus subtraction is just the discrete \"version\" of (^) dxd. Don't worry, you don't need to have fully understood any of the integration or differentiation stuff I just talked about, or even to have taken calculus yet. I'm just trying to give you some feel for what \"discrete\" means, and how the dichotomy between discrete and continuous really runs through all of math and computer science. In this book, we will mostly be focusing on discrete values and structures, which turn out to be of more use in computer science. That's partially because as you probably know, computers \n4 CHAPTER 1. MEETUP AT THE TRAILHEAD \nthemselves are discrete, and can only store and compute discrete values. There can be many of them -- megabytes, gigabytes, terabytes -- but each value stored is fundamentally comprised of bits, each of which has a value of either 0 or 1. This is unlike the human brain, by the way, whose neuronal synapses communicate based on the _continuous_ quantities of chemicals present in their axons. So I guess \"computer\" and \"brain\" are another pair of entries we could add to our discrete vs. continuous list. \nThere's another reason, though, why discrete math is of more use to computer scientists than continuous math is, beyond just the bits-and-bytes thing. Simply put, computers operate algorithmically. They carry out programs in step-by-step, iterative fashion. First do this, then do that, then move on to something else. This mechanical execution, like the ticking of a clock, permeates everything the computer can do, and everything we can tell it to do. At a given moment in time, the computer _has_ completed step 7, but _not_ step 8; it has accumulated 38 values, but not yet 39; its database has exactly 15 entries in it, no more and no less; it knows that after accepting this friend request, there will be exactly 553 people in your set of friends. The whole paradigm behind reasoning about computers and their programs is discrete, and that's why we computer scientists find different problems worth thinking about than most of the world did a hundred years ago. \nBut it's still math. It's just _discrete_ math. There's a lot to come, so limber up and let me know when you're ready to hit the road. \n**1.1 Exercises** \nUse an index card or a piece of paper folded lengthwise, and cover up the right-hand column of the exercises below. Read each exercise in the left-hand column, answer it in your mind, then slide the index card down to reveal the answer and see if you're right! For every exercise you missed, figure out why you missed it before moving on. \n 1.1. EXERCISES 5 \n1. What's the opposite     of concrete? \n Abstract. \n2. What's the opposite     of discrete? \n Continuous. \n3. Consider a quantity     of water in a glass.     Would you call it ab-     stract, or concrete?     Discrete, or continu-     ous? \n Concrete, since it's a real entity you can experience with the senses. Continuous, since it could be any number of ounces (or liters, or tablespoons, or whatever). The amount of water certainly doesn't have to be an integer. (Food for thought: since all matter is ultimately comprised of atoms, are even substances like water discrete?) \n4. Consider the number \n27. Would you call it abstract, or concrete? Discrete, or continu- ous? \n Abstract, since you can't see or touch or smell \"twenty-seven.\" Probably discrete, since it's an integer, and when we think of whole numbers we think \"discrete.\" (Food for thought: in real life, how would you know whether I meant the integer \"27\" or the decimal number \"27.0?\" And does it matter?) \n5. Consider a bit in a     computer's memory.     Would you call it ab-     stract, or concrete?     Discrete, or continu-     ous? \n Clearly it's discrete. Abstract vs. concrete, though, is a little tricky. If we're talking about the actual transistor and capacitor that's physically present in the hardware, holding a tiny charge in some little chip, then it's concrete. But if we're talking about the value \"1\" that is conceptually part of the computer's currently executing state, then it's really abstract just like 27 was.

Very specific, higher stakes, more complex answers As you hone your path of inquiry, you may need to zoom in or out in terms of scope: depending on your rhetorical situation, you will need different degrees of focus. Just like narration, research writing benefits from a careful consideration of scope. Often, a narrower scope is easier to work with than a broader scope--you will be able to write more and write better if your question asks for more complex thinking. It's important to be flexible throughout your research project. Be prepared to pivot topics, adjust your research question, change your opinions, and confront unanticipated challenges. As you build a working knowledge of your topic, you might complicate or narrow your working questions. Gradually, try to articulate a research question (or combination of questions). Remember to be flexible as you research though: you might need to pivot, adjust, refocus, or replace your research question as you learn more. Consider this imaginary case study as an example of this process: Ahmed began his project by identifying the following areas of interest: racism in the US, technology in medicine and health care, and independent filmmaking. After doing some freewriting and preliminary research on each, he decided he wanted to learn more about racially motivated police violence. He developed working questions: \n#### WORKING QUESTIONS \n A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 146 \n Are police officers likely to make judgments about citizens based on their race?  Have police forces instituted policies to avoid racism?  Who is most vulnerable to police violence?  Why does it seem like police officers target people of color? Who is responsible for overseeing the police? He realized that he needed to narrow his focus to develop a more viable path of inquiry, eventually ending up with the following research question:  Over the last thirty years, what populations are most likely to experience police violence in the US? However, after completing more research, Ahmed discovered that his answers came pretty readily: young Black men are significantly more vulnerable to be victims of police violence. He realized that he was not really saying anything new, so he had to tweak his path of inquiry. Ahmed did some more freewriting and dug around to find a source that disagreed with him or added a new layer to his answers. He discovered eventually that there are a handful of police organizations that have made genuine efforts to confront racism in their practices. Despite the widespread and normalized violence enacted against people of color, these groups were working against racial violence. He reoriented his research question to be the following:  Have antiracist police trainings and strategies been effective in reducing individual or institutional racism over the last thirty years?

What was the last thing that pulled you down     an internet rabbit hole? \n**2.** How would you adapt the following question so that it leads to further     inquiry and analysis rather than the straightforward reporting of facts?     \"How can the average consumer reduce their carbon emissions?\" \n#### DISCUSSION QUESTIONS \n A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 148 \n**1.** Brainstorming. Create a catalog of topics you are personally curious     about--things that you want to learn more about. These don't have to be     revolutionary things right away; it's more important that they're     meaningful to you.        **a.** First, choose three of the following broad topic           headings: politics, science and technology, food, sports,           music and art, other cultures and nations, social justice,           the environment and sustainability, health and disease,           business and economy, education. On your first sheet           of a three-column paper, write those three topic           headings. **b.** Next, underneath each topic heading, write bulleted lists of as many subtopics or related ideas that come to mind that interest you. (Try not to censor yourself here--the idea is to generate a large number of bullet points. To some extent, this is an exercise in free association: What are the first things that come to mind when you think of each topic?) Spend ten to fifteen minutes on your lists.        **c.** Read over your lists, making note especially of items           that surprised you. Choose the three items from the           full page that most interest you. You can choose one           from each column, three from the same, or any           combination of lists, so long as you have three items           that you care about. \n**2.** Idea generation: Internet stumbling. In addition to its status as an ever-     expanding repository of knowledge and in addition to its contributions to     global human connection, the internet is also an exceptional free-     association machine. Through the magic of hyperlinks and social media,     random chance can set us in the right direction to develop a research topic.        Spend fifteen to twenty minutes clicking around on the internet,        using one of the following media for guidance, and jot down every        potential topic that piques your interest.           **a.** Wikipedia: Go to the Wikipedia homepage and check              out the \"featured article\" of the day, or choose              \"Random Article\" from the sidebar on the far left. Click \n#### ACTIVITIES \n149 COLLECTED WORKS \n any of the hyperlinks in the article to redirect to a different page. Bounce from article to article, keeping track of the titles of pages and sections that catch your eye. b. An Instagram, Facebook, Reddit, or Twitter feed: Flow through one or more social media feeds, using links, geotags, user handles, and hashtags to encounter a variety of posts. c. After stumbling, review the list you've made of potentially interesting topics. Are you already familiar with any of them? Which surprised you? Are there any relationships or intersections worth exploring further? From these topics and subtopics, try to articulate a viable and interesting research question that speaks to your curiosity. \n**3.** Moving from topics to questions: Small group activity. Begin to develop     working and research questions by collaborating with your classmates to     explore different curiosities.        **a.** Divide your paper into three columns. Write three           potential topics as headings, one in each column. **b.** Sit in a circle with your groupmates; each student should pass their three-column paper one position clockwise. For five minutes, each student will freewrite questions about each topic. No question is too big or small, too simple or complex. Try to generate as many questions as you possibly can. Then rotate your papers another step--repeat until you have your original sheet of paper back.        **c.** Review the questions your groupmates compiled on           your sheet. Have they offered anything that surprises           you--issues you haven't thought of, relationships           between questions, recurring themes or patterns of           interest, or foci that might yield interesting answers? \n**4.** Moving from topics to questions: Whole class gallery walk.

Such consternation! Educators are fond of research papers because they require you to find your own sources, confront conflicting evidence, and synthesize diverse information and ideas--all skills required in any professional leadership role. Research papers also allow students to pursue their own topic of interest; your professors have to assume that you are genuinely interested in at least some major part of the course. The open-endedness of research papers sets you up to do your best work as a self-motivated scholar. This chapter is about secondary sources: what they are, where to find them, and how to choose them. For example, let's think about the distinction between primary and secondary sources. Primary sources are original documents, data, or images: the law code of the Le Dynasty in Vietnam, the letters of Kurt Vonnegut, data gathered from an experiment on color perception, an interview, or Farm Service Administration photographs from the 1930s. Secondary sources are produced by analyzing primary sources. They include news articles, scholarly articles, reviews of films or art exhibitions, documentary films, and other pieces that have some descriptive or analytical purpose. Some things may be primary sources in one context but secondary sources in another. For example, if you're using news articles to inform an analysis of a historical event, they're serving as secondary sources. If you're counting the number of times a particular newspaper reported on different types of events, then the news articles are serving as primary sources because they're more akin to raw data. You've probably heard by now that if you cite Wikipedia as an authoritative source, the wrath of your instructor shall be visited upon you. Why is it that even the most informative Wikipedia articles are still often considered illegitimate? And what are good sources to use? The table below summarizes the types of secondary sources in four tiers. All sources have their legitimate uses, but the top-tier ones are preferable for citation in an academic context. \n#### AH, THE RESEARCH PAPER \n#### SOME SOURCES ARE BETTER THAN OTHERS \n A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 154 \n Table 20.1 Analyzing the quality of secondary sources \n##### Tier Type Content Uses How to find them \n##### Tier \n##### I \n Peer-reviewed academic publications Rigorous research and analysis Provide strong evidence for claims and references to other high-quality sources Google Scholar, library catalogs, and academic article databases \n##### Tier \n##### II \n Reports, articles, and books from credible nonacademic sources Well-researched and even-handed descriptions of an event or state of the world Initial research on events or trends not yet analyzed in the academic literature; may reference important Tier 1 sources Websites of relevant agencies, Google searches using *.gov or *.org sites, academic article databases \n##### Tier \n##### III \n Short pieces from newspapers or credible websites Simple reporting of events, research findings, or policy changes Often point to useful Tier 2 or Tier 1 sources; may provide a factoid or two not found anywhere else Strategic Google searches or article databases, including newspapers and magazines \n##### Tier \n##### IV \n Agenda-driven or uncertain pieces Mostly opinion, varying in thoughtfulness and credibility May represent a particular position within a debate; more often provide keywords and clues about higher-quality sources Nonspecific Google </passage>"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<tool_call>\\n{\"arguments\": {\"queries\": [\"Based on the information provided, what is likely to happen next in terms of research for Ahmed's revised question?\", 'What do you think are the potential outcomes of further research on racially motivated police violence?', 'In your opinion, what is the likely future of marijuana legalization in the United States?'], \"name\": \"ExpertQAExtractor\"}}\\n</tool_call>"}]}

Academic writing in the humanities and social sciences is somewhere in between these two extremes--depending on the subject and context, a writer can make their own choice. Many well-known scholars in these fields use an \"I\" in their academic papers, especially if their connection to the subject \n### \"TO BE\" VERB (IS, ARE, WAS, ETC.) + \n### PAST PARTICIPLE (WALKED, TAKEN, \n### SEEN, ETC.) = PASSIVE VOICE \n A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 206 \n is important to understanding their perspective or point. Some authors use it just a little bit--maybe they open their article with a personal anecdote before moving into a more objective tone--while others use it throughout a piece of writing. It's worth noting that although writing without the \"I\" can be read as more objective, all writing is created by people with perspectives and stances. If I make an argument, it doesn't matter if I frame it with \"I argue\" or not; it's still my argument. From one perspective, then, using an \"I\" voice is simply more transparent about the subjectivity of the work. The \"I\" voice is slightly less formal, although it can still have a place in academic writing. It can also feel quite personal, depending on the subject. Consider the difference between these two sentences: While I recognize the potential value of a longer school day in improving test scores, I don't agree that the benefits are worth the cost. While a longer school day may improve test scores, the benefits aren't worth the cost. How would you describe the difference between these two? You can see how even minor changes like this have an impact on how they \"sound\" to the reader's ear. \n##### Syntax \n The word syntax comes originally from ancient Greek: sun (arrange) and tassein (together) became the Greek word suntaxis. The syntax of a sentence is how it's arranged or how the words are put together. This isn't just a question of correctness; the structure or order of a sentence affects how it strikes its audience. Consider a widespread example from the well-known style guide by Strunk and White. Thomas Paine wrote, \"These are the times that try men's souls.\" How do these rewrites change the impact of the message?  Times like these try men's souls.  How trying it is to live in these times!  These are trying times for men's souls.  Soulwise, these are trying times. As you can see, sentences gain or lose power depending on how they're structured. Longer sentences can seem more formal, but shorter sentences can be more direct and impactful in their own way. Sentences can be combined using semicolons, em dashes, and more; each method will have a slightly different \"feel.\" This can be a fun thing to play around with! Experiment with your own writing by rewriting one sentence in three ways. Which one do you like most? \n##### Tone \n When you were a kid, you may have heard a grown-up say, \"Don't use that tone with me!\" As a parent myself, I have to admit that I have said these words more than I ever imagined I would. 207 COLLECTED WORKS \n When someone says this, they are usually hearing something in your tone--the attitude of your voice--that they don't like. In other words, the way you speak conveys your attitude toward the listener or the situation. The same is true in writing. Tone is the author's attitude toward their subject or their audience. It might be humorous, sarcastic, intimate, distanced, light, serious, warm, cold, subjective, objective, gloomy, cheerful, formal, informal, or something else. This tone comes from word choice (diction), point of view, sentence structure (syntax), and even punctuation. \n##### Formality \n The level of formality in your writing is one important element of tone. This is one of the most obvious differences between a text message and an email to your professor, as we considered above. Academic writing tends to be somewhat formal, although it should still be clear and understandable. Formality is determined by word choice (diction) and sentence structure (syntax). In English, there are often many phrases and words that mean the same thing, but they have different connotations--including their level of formality. Consider the following: The research team will look into these issues. The research team will investigate these issues. Which is more formal? As you can see, word choice has a big impact. Try it for yourself. Can you come up with a more formal substitution for the following phrases?  Come around  Decide  Do tests  Find  Fit in  Futz around  Judge  Make of (as in \"What do you make of it?\")  Pin down  Stick to my position  Read up on  Turn up  Work with A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 208 \n Again, the goal here isn't to change who you are or how you speak. It's about fitting into the genre expectations of whatever you're writing, knowing that your ideas can be more effectively communicated if you adapt to the audience and context. In academic writing, this means making your word choice a bit more formal. The reverse is also true: your friends might roll their eyes if you started texting them with formal academic language! How would you adapt these phrases into a more conversational style?  Examine  Indoctrinate  Interrogate  Probe  Regulate  Resolve  Scrutinize Three more simple ways to adjust the level of formality in your writing: \n**1.** Contractions (can't, don't, it's) are an informal move. You can remove them to     make your writing more formal. However, this is not a strict rule! It's a choice     that you can make as a writer: How formal do you want to be? Are there     times, even in academic writing, where a contraction flows better? \n**2.** Some common transition phrases are inherently formal. Have you ever heard     someone say \"while this may be the case\" or \"therefore\" in casual     conversation?! Only if you have very fancy friends. You can add these to boost     your formality or cut them to make your writing more approachable and     relatable. \n**3.** Exclamation points are also informal. Again, they're not forbidden in     academic writing--but they are infrequent. Use them only with intention and     care to highlight an important point. \n##### Voice \n Imagine you're sitting around with your friends, debating the qualities of a recent Netflix series. Even though you're all talking about the same thing, the way you say things is different: the resonance of your actual voice, of course, but also your word choice, accent, speed, and more. This is true in writing too. In any piece of writing, you can include some of your personal \"voice\" in the piece. Letting yourself shine through often makes a paper more interesting and engaging to read! Voice is the part of your writing that is unique to you as a writer; it's like your fingerprint (or, well, your voice). It comes from word choice, syntax, punctuation, and point of view. 209 COLLECTED WORKS \nVoice is related to tone but slightly different. Voice is about who you are as a writer, while tone is about how you feel about your subject or audience. In other words, my voice is still my own, whether I'm annoyed, charmed, or frazzled. What part of your voice comes through--and how much--might depend on the audience and context of the piece. For that reason, many writers have an academic writing \"persona.\" In other words, writers choose (consciously or unconsciously) to present a particular aspect of their character in an academic setting. That doesn't mean it's fake, but it's how they want to be seen in that context (and is probably not a full view of every part of who they are). Of course, you can imagine how this could _feel_ fake if you are new to academic writing or if academic style asks you to push aside your language background or dialect. Writing personas and voice raise complicated questions about what we expect of writers and students. For example, in writing this chapter, I am writing in a teacherly persona. My voice here is similar to how I would speak in a classroom: warm, friendly, and unpretentious. My tone or attitude toward the subject (style) and the audience (you) is informal and, I hope, encouraging and helpful without being patronizing. The voice I am using here is authentic--it does really feel true to me and who I am--and that's easy for me to achieve after teaching for many years. It's mostly unconscious at this point, but that certainly wasn't the case when I started my career! Even still, this writing voice isn't every part of me. My voice can be sassier--or even raucous!--in a lively text chain with friends, and it's stern in an angry email to my insurance company. However, in all of those scenarios, you can hear me. How I write is always a little different than how you write--and that's a good thing. It makes writing more interesting and engaging to read. One of the best ways to develop your voice is to write a lot. You might try writing a page a day, or reading your own work out loud, or asking a friend to read through your work. Writers have to \"find\" their own voice through time and practice. Ultimately, the goal is to find a balance between yourself and the writing expectations of the genre. Find an academic writing style (or persona) that feels appropriate and--if possible--true to who you are. A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 210 \n**1.** Do you think it's problematic to ask students to write only in standardized     English? Who benefits from this expectation and who is harmed? How     might this expectation impact writers' experience or success in the     classroom or other settings? \n**2.** Vershawn Ashanti Young argues that rather than expecting students to     shift between their personal dialects and dominant (standardized) English,     we should all become \"plurilingual\" in order to better understand and be     open to a mix of dialects. What do you think about this solution? \n**3.** Why is wordiness a problem at a sentence or paragraph level? Why does     this matter, do you think?

Why might     they have made this writerly choice? \n**4.** Find a recent text chain or social media post that you wrote and \"translate\"     it into more formal, academic language. \n**5.** Take a paragraph from a scholarly article and \"translate\" it into more     informal, conversational language. Which do you think is more effective?     What are some different audiences that might work for both? \n**6.** Select four to five sentences from an article or book that you admire. Now,     try writing your own sentences in the same syntax as the original. In other     words, steal the structure of the sentence, but write about an entirely new     topic. Example: I came, I saw, I conquered. My rewrite: She woke, she     blinked, she sighed. \n**7.** Rewrite each of the following sentences in three different ways (same     content and ideas, just a different order).

In the more organic structure (figure 12.2), each paragraph specifically leads to the next. The last key difference is seen in the conclusion. Because the organic essay is driven by an ambitious, nonobvious argument, the reader comes to the concluding section thinking, \"OK, I'm convinced by the argument. What do you, author, make of it? Why does it matter?\" The conclusion of an organically structured paper has a real job to do. It doesn't just reiterate the thesis; it explains why the thesis matters. 93 COLLECTED WORKS \n Fig 12.2 The organic college paper The substantial time you spent mastering the five-paragraph form in figure 12.1 was time well spent; it's hard to imagine anyone succeeding with the more organic form without the organizational skills and habits of mind inherent in the simpler form. (And it is worth noting that there are limited moments in college where the five-paragraph structure is still useful--inclass essay exams, for example.) But if you assume that you must adhere rigidly to the simpler form, you're blunting your intellectual ambition. Your instructors will not be impressed by obvious theses, loosely related body paragraphs, and repetitive conclusions. They want you to undertake an ambitious independent analysis, one that will yield a thesis that is somewhat surprising and challenging to explain. You have no doubt been drilled on the need for a thesis statement and its proper location at the end of the introduction. And you also know that all of the key points of the paper should clearly support the central driving thesis. Indeed, the whole model of the five-paragraph theme hinges on a clearly stated and consistent thesis. However, some students are surprised--and dismayed--when some of their early college papers are criticized for not having a good thesis. Their instructor might even claim that the paper doesn't have a thesis when, in the author's view, it clearly does. So what makes a good thesis in college? High school teachers needed to make sure that you and all your classmates mastered \n#### THE THREE-STORY THESIS \n##### FROM THE GROUND UP \n##### 1. A good thesis is nonobvious \n A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 94 \n the basic form of the academic essay. Thus, they were mostly concerned that you had a clear and consistent thesis, even if it was something obvious like \"Sustainability is important.\" A thesis statement like that has a wide enough scope to incorporate several supporting points and concurring evidence, enabling the writer to demonstrate his or her mastery of the five-paragraph form. Good enough! When they can, high school teachers nudge students to develop arguments that are less obvious and more engaging. College instructors, though, fully expect you to produce something more developed. In everyday life, \"arguable\" is often used as a synonym for \"doubtful.\" For a thesis, though, \"arguable\" means that it's worth arguing: it's something with which a reasonable person might disagree. This arguability criterion dovetails with the nonobvious one: it shows that the author has deeply explored a problem and arrived at an argument that legitimately needs three, five, ten, or twenty pages to explain and justify. In that way, a good thesis sets an ambitious agenda for a paper. A thesis like \"Sustainability is important\" isn't at all difficult to argue for, and the reader would have little intrinsic motivation to read the rest of the paper. However, an arguable thesis like \"Sustainability policies will inevitably fail if they do not incorporate social justice\" brings up some healthy skepticism. Thus, the arguable thesis makes the reader want to keep reading. Some student writers fear that they're giving away the game if they specify their thesis up front; they think that a purposefully vague thesis might be more intriguing to the reader. However, consider movie trailers: they always include the most exciting and poignant moments from the film to attract an audience. In academic papers, too, a clearly stated and specific thesis indicates that the author has thought rigorously about an issue and done thorough research, which makes the reader want to keep reading. Don't just say that a particular policy is effective or fair; say what makes it so. If you want to argue that a particular claim is dubious or incomplete, say why in your thesis. There is no such thing as spoilers in an academic paper. Suppose your assignment is to write a paper about some aspect of the history of linen production and trade, a topic that may seem exceedingly arcane. And suppose you have constructed a well-supported and creative argument that linen was so widely traded in the ancient Mediterranean that it actually served as a kind of currency. That's a strong, insightful, arguable, well-specified thesis. But which of these thesis statements do you find more engaging?  Version A: Linen served as a form of currency in the ancient Mediterranean world, connecting rival empires through circuits of trade.  Version B: Linen served as a form of currency in the \n##### 2.

The economic role of linen raises important questions about how shifting environmental conditions can influence economic relationships and, by extension, political conflicts. Putting your claims in their broader context makes them more interesting to your reader and more impressive to your instructors, who, after all, assign topics that they think have enduring significance. Finding that significance for yourself makes the most of both your paper and your learning. Ask yourself, _So what?_ Why does this issue or argument matter? Why is it important? Addressing these questions will go a long way toward making your paper more complex and engaging. How do you produce a good, strong thesis? And how do you know when you've gotten there? Many instructors and writers embrace a metaphor based on this passage by Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr. (1809-1894). He compares a good thesis to a three-story building: In other words,  **One-story theses state inarguable facts.** What's the background?  **Two-story theses bring in an arguable (interpretive or analytical) point**. What is your argument?  **Three-story theses nest that point within its larger, compelling implications**. Why does it matter? There are one-story intellects, two-story intellects, and three-story intellects with skylights. All fact collectors who have no aim beyond their facts are one-story men. Two-story men compare, reason, generalize using the labor of fact collectors as their own. Three-story men idealize, imagine, predict--their best illumination comes from above the skylight. (50) A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 96 \n Thesis: that's the word that pops at me whenever I write an essay. Seeing this word in the prompt scared me and made me think to myself, \"Oh great, what are they really looking for?\" or \"How am I going to make a thesis for a college paper?\" When rehearing that I would be focusing on theses again in a class, I said to myself, \"Here we go again!\" But after learning about the three-story thesis, I never had a problem with writing another thesis. In fact, I look forward to being asked on a paper to create a thesis. TIMOTHEE PIZARRO writing student The concept of a three-story thesis framework was the most helpful piece of information I gained from the writing component of DCC 100. The first time I utilized it in a college paper, my professor included \"good thesis\" and \"excellent introduction\" in her notes and graded it significantly higher than my previous papers. You can expect similar results if you dig deeper to form three-story theses. More importantly, doing so will make the actual writing of your paper more straightforward as well. Arguing something specific makes the structure of your paper much easier to design. PETER FARRELL writing student The biggest benefit of the three-story metaphor is that it describes a process for building a thesis. To build the first story or level, you first have to get familiar with the complex, relevant facts surrounding the problem or question. You have to be able to describe the situation thoroughly and accurately. Then with that first story built, you can layer on the second story by formulating the insightful, arguable point that animates the analysis. That's often the most effortful part: brainstorming, elaborating and comparing alternative ideas, finalizing your point. With that specified, you can frame up the third story by articulating why the point you make matters beyond its particular topic or case. For example, imagine you have been assigned a paper about the impact of online learning in higher education. You would first construct an account of the origins and multiple forms of online learning and assess research findings on its use and effectiveness. If you've done that well, you'll probably come up with a well-considered opinion that wouldn't be obvious to readers who haven't looked at the issue in depth. Maybe you'll want to argue that online learning is a threat to the academic community. Or perhaps you'll want to make the case that online learning opens up pathways to college degrees that traditional campus-based learning does not. In the course of developing your central, argumentative point, you'll come to recognize its larger context; in this example, you may claim that online learning can serve to better integrate higher education with the rest of society, as online learners bring their educational and career experiences together. Here is an example: Online learning is becoming more prevalent and takes many different forms. \n##### First story (facts only) \n97 COLLECTED WORKS \n While most observers see it as a transformation of higher education, online learning is better thought of as an extension of higher education in that it reaches learners who aren't disposed to participate in traditional campus-based education. Online learning appears to be a promising way to better integrate higher education with other institutions in society, as online learners integrate their educational experiences with the other realms of their life, promoting the freer flow of ideas between the academy and the rest of society. The final thesis would be all three of these pieces together. These stories build on one another; they don't replace the previous story. Here's another example of a three-story thesis: Edith Wharton did not consider herself a modernist writer, and she didn't write like her modernist contemporaries. However, in her work, we can see her grappling with both the questions and literary forms that fascinated modernist writers of her era. While not an avowed modernist, she did engage with modernist themes and questions. Thus, it is more revealing to think of modernism as a conversation rather than a category or practice. Here's one more example: Scientists disagree about the likely impact in the US of the light brown apple moth (LBAM), an agricultural pest native to Australia. Research findings to date suggest that the decision to spray pheromones over the skies of several Southern Californian counties to combat the LBAM was poorly thought out. Together, the scientific ambiguities and the controversial response strengthen the claim that industrial-style approaches to pest management are inherently unsustainable. \n##### Second story (arguable point) \n##### Third story (larger implications) \n##### First story \n##### Second story \n##### Third story \n##### First story \n##### Second story \n##### Third story \n A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 98 \n A thesis statement that stops at the first story isn't usually considered a thesis. A two-story thesis is usually considered competent, though some two-story theses are more intriguing and ambitious than others. A thoughtfully crafted and well-informed three-story thesis puts the author on a smooth path toward an excellent paper. The three-story thesis is a beautiful thing. For one, it gives a paper authentic momentum. The first paragraph doesn't just start with some broad, vague statement; every sentence is crucial for setting up the thesis. The body paragraphs build on one another, moving through each step of the logical chain. Each paragraph leads inevitably to the next, making the transitions from paragraph to paragraph feel wholly natural. The conclusion, instead of being a mirror-image paraphrase of the introduction, builds out the third story by explaining the broader implications of the argument. It offers new insight without departing from the flow of the analysis. I should note here that a paper with this kind of momentum often reads like it was knocked out in one inspired sitting. But in reality, just like accomplished athletes, artists, and musicians, masterful writers make the difficult thing look easy. As writer Anne Lamott notes, reading a well-written piece feels like its author sat down and typed it out, \"bounding along like huskies across the snow.\" However, she continues, Experienced writers don't figure out what they want to say and then write it. They write in order to figure out what they want to say. Experienced writers develop theses in dialogue with the body of the essay. An initial characterization of the problem leads to a tentative thesis, and then drafting the body of the paper reveals thorny contradictions or critical areas of ambiguity, prompting the writer to revisit or expand the body of evidence and then refine the thesis based on that fresh look. The revised thesis may require that body paragraphs be reordered and reshaped to fit the emerging three-story thesis. Throughout the process, the thesis serves as an anchor point while the author wades through the morass of facts and ideas. The dialogue between thesis and body continues until the author is satisfied or the due date arrives, whatever comes first. It's an effortful and sometimes tedious process. Novice writers, in contrast, usually oversimplify the writing process. They formulate some first-impression thesis, produce a reasonably organized outline, and then flesh it out with text, never taking the time to reflect or truly revise their work. They assume that revision is a step backward when, in reality, it is a major step forward. \n#### THREE-STORY THESES AND THE ORGANICALLY STRUCTURED ARGUMENT \n This is just the fantasy of the uninitiated. I know some very great writers, writers you love who write beautifully and have made a great deal of money, and not one of them sits down routinely feeling wildly enthusiastic and confident.

This specific question raises the urgency of her thesis. The thesis statement is no longer the student-writer's idle thoughts about a random topic; it's a specific response to an urgent question. In this way, using the \"gap in the research strategy\" provides writers with a purpose for writing and readers with an answer to \"So what?\" A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 110 \n Exigency is not always invoked by explaining a gap in the current research; there are times when the best way to demonstrate a topic's importance is to redefine what the issue is about. You might think of this rhetorical strategy as \"reframing\" an issue. Writers reframe their subject matter by shifting our understanding of the surrounding context. In other words, it's a matter of what ideas, words, memories, or beliefs we associate an issue with. Consider, for instance, an issue that arose in the summer of 2010 in New York City. A national controversy was spurred by plans to build an Islamic cultural center a few blocks away from where the World Trade Center towers had been located before they were destroyed in the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks (Fisher). These construction plans spurred debate about whether the cultural center was symbolically appropriate and whether it was an embodiment of American values or an insult to those values. Many people questioned whether it was appropriate for the Islamic center--sometimes referred to as the Cordoba house--to be placed near the location of a horrific terroristic attack (Fisher). Since millions of Americans who opposed the Islamic center may have felt a sense of urgency about stopping its construction, a speech in favor of the center would face a particular challenge. The speech would need to address a skeptical audience, and it would need to convey a sense of exigency about why the completed construction of the Cordoba house was indispensable for America's future (the precise opposite of the audience's perspective). New York mayor Michael Bloomberg made such an argument and crafted exigent circumstances by redefining the context. Instead of people associating the Cordoba house with \"ground zero,\" \"September 11,\" or religious effrontery, he needed them to associate it with America's long history of religious tolerance. Bloomberg catches hold of his readers' attention by reframing the issue in at least two ways. First, he connects the topic of the Cordoba house to religious freedom from the founding of New York City in the seventeenth century. Early in his speech, he states, \"Of all our precious freedoms, the most important may be the freedom to worship as we wish. And it is a freedom that, even here in a city that is rooted in Dutch tolerance, was hard-won over many years.\" Bloomberg then reviews how Jewish immigrants, Quakers, and Catholics all faced resistance from others in New York. By connecting the recent Islamic controversy to similar past conflicts, he can argue that \"we would betray our values--and play into our enemies' hands--if we were to treat Muslims differently than anyone else.\" Only after reframing the debate from one about civic sensibility and 9/11 to one concerning religious freedom can the mayor explain why his message is indispensable to his listener. He skillfully waits until the middle of his speech to confidently assert, \"I believe that this is an important test of the separation of church and state as we may see in our lifetime--as important a test--and it is critically important that we get it right.\" His argument that the government should not prohibit people from worshipping as they wish could have been made without these exigent circumstances, but their inclusion changes the tone from one of a defensive posture to a more vigorous one. This example provides at least three lessons about exigency: \n1. Sometimes it's best to invoke exigency in the middle of the text or even in the     conclusion. \n2. Consider delaying invoking exigency (a) when your reader doesn't share your     underlying assumptions, (b) when your reader is unaware of the ongoing     academic discussion, (c) when it's more important to leave your readers with a     lasting impression than it is to grab their attention immediately, and (d) when \n#### EXIGENCY THROUGH REFRAMING THE SUBJECT MATTER \n111 COLLECTED WORKS \n your thesis is placed in the middle or the end of your paper. \n3. Whether reframing an issue or finding a gap in the research, exigency often     involves connecting one's thesis with the audience's values. Reframing an     issue involves the additional step of suggesting that readers focus on a     different set of values than they otherwise would. Sometimes writers try to surprise their readers with a bold claim, a counterintuitive idea, or a reconsidered foundational premise. Consider the following titles of bestselling books: ; _The World Is Flat: A Brief History of the Twenty-First Century_ , by Thomas L. Friedman ; _Everything Bad Is Good for You: How Today's Popular Culture Is Actually Making Us Smarter_ , by Steven Johnson ; _The Wisdom of the Crowds: Why the Many Are Smarter Than the Few and How Collective Wisdom Shapes Business, Economics, Societies and Nations_ , by James Surowiecki Each of these books tries to revolutionize the way that we think about their topics. The titles are crafted to provoke a confused but intrigued response: \"What does the author mean by that?\" \"Is there something I don't know?\" Bold claims can usually command attention, but only if the importance of the idea and its degree of innovation are properly established. Even if there is a radically new way of looking at something, it may appear quotidian. If you can appear to be turning the world on its head, unveiling an unseen world, or persuading people that up is in fact down, then you will have your readers' undivided attention. In the following exegesis of Wendy Cope's poem \"Lonely Hearts,\" the student-writer proffers a counterintuitive analysis of the tone of the poem. On the surface, the villanelle appears to have a light mood that speaks of unfulfilled relationships, but a darker tone surprisingly lies underneath this initial interpretation: Solitude. It is a fear that has crossed many a mind for ages--the idea of being alone or, worst of all, dying alone. But is this loneliness individualistic in nature? Or does it serve to represent a tragic element of the human condition: to be in a constant search of companionship, an obsession so hard-wired that we often fail to see the bonds from person to person? These are questions explored by Wendy Cope in her poem \"Lonely Hearts,\" a villanelle written in the form of pieced-together personal ads from a newspaper. On the basic level, \"Lonely Hearts\" amuses and entertains, seeming to poke fun at those \"lonely hearts\" that place personal ads. But upon closer reading, the serious underpinnings of Cope's poem reveal themselves, and a deeper theme emerges. Through the careful use of personal ad language, villanelle form, and ambiguity of point of view, Wendy Cope illustrates the shared loneliness of the poem's speakers that ultimately renders the poem ironic. \n#### EXIGENCY THROUGH A RADICAL REINTERPRETATION OF \n#### KNOWLEDGE OR EXPERIENCE \n#### RADICAL REINTERPRETATION IN STUDENT WRITING \n A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 112 \n Can you spot how the student's introduction creates a surprise? There is a slow shift in her language from a theme of loneliness expressed with a jovial tone to one of \"shared loneliness\" (a term that is counterintuitive itself) expressed with sobriety. The second half of the paragraph contains the thesis, but it's the first half that makes the thesis worth investigating. It invites readers to reconsider a poem that they have merely glossed over. It's like Alice going through the rabbit hole. Each genre has its own conventions and might easily fit with one of these strategies more than others. The word genre refers to a set of rhetorical expectations that accompany a recurring type of writing, whether it be practical or artistic. For instance, in business writing, there are rhetorical expectations that are associated with positive newsletters and a separate set of expectations for business letters that give people negative news. There are rhetorical expectations for emails, text messages, news articles, poetry, drama, and even movie trailers, to name a few genres. Genre conventions are not hard and fast rules, but they do provide guidance. For instance, I would advise matching the genres below with the strategies to their right. Keep in mind these are merely suggestions. Any of the four strategies described above could work for any of the genres below, if creatively applied. ; Job application materials : Definitely \"exigency through the audience's agenda or concerns\" applies here. It's at the heart of any resume or job letter. What you can do for the company is the only thing a potential employer cares about. ; Literary analysis : \"Finding a gap in the research\" is the most common strategy, but reframing the issue and creating a counterintuitive idea are wonderful approaches as well. ; Business proposal : \"Exigency through the audience's agenda or concerns\" is the most appropriate. ; Term paper (where the topic has been discussed in class) : With an ongoing discussion of references made in class, you could use any of the final three strategies. ; Term paper (where the topic has been written about exhaustively or where the positions people take are predictable) : This is the most difficult type of paper to write about (i.e., abortion, gun control, legalization of marijuana). Use the reframing technique or the counterintuitive technique to create a fresh perspective. These strategies are oftentimes used simultaneously, and you may have noticed that there is some overlap between them. Though they may be nebulous categorizations, they provide a useful tool for providing a sense of urgency to your writing. I have personally found that when I think about exigency, it helps add passion to my writing, and it gives me a voice as a writer. Without exigency, I'm an aimless soul drifting in the dark night without a sail or a strong wind. But exigency brings with it a definition of who I am in the text (my persona), who my readers are \n#### GENRE AND EXIGENCY: FINDING THE RIGHT FIT \n113 COLLECTED WORKS \n(their personas), and the common bonds that connect us together. If you use these techniques it will help animate your writing and motivate your readers to keep reading and carefully consider your argument.

I've found that students go through a layered understanding of a prompt, at first understanding the basic concept and then looking more carefully at the prompt's specific requirements. But what makes their papers far more effective is if they can take ownership of the prompt--in other words, if they can consider a way of making it more than simply an assignment, making it an opportunity for them to address an issue they are passionate about to a specific audience. To help them develop this sense of audience and purpose, a discussion of exigency can be beneficial. This is one reason to talk about exigency at the beginning of the writing project. The discussion about it will differ depending on how narrowly their purpose and audience are being defined by the writing prompt, but either way, the beginning of the project is the first and probably best place to discuss exigency. \n#### WORKS CITED \n#### TEACHER RESOURCES FOR EXIGENCY: WHAT MAKES MY \n#### MESSAGE INDISPENSABLE TO MY READER BY QUENTIN VIEREGGE \n A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 114 \n It can also be helpful to discuss exigency when students are writing their introductory paragraphs or concluding paragraphs or as they are revising their drafts to craft a more compelling argument.

What is an essay? It's likely that your teachers have been asking you to write essays for years now; you've probably formed some idea of the genre. But when I ask my students to define this kind of writing, their answers vary widely and only get at part of the meaning of \"essay.\" Although we typically talk of an essay (noun), I find it instructive to think about essay (verb): to try, to test, to explore, to attempt to understand. An essay (noun), then, is an attempt and an exploration. Popularized shortly before the Enlightenment era by Michel de Montaigne, the essay form was invested in the notion that writing invites discovery: the idea was that he, as a layperson without formal education in a specific discipline, would learn more about a subject through the act of writing itself. What difference does this new definition make for us as writers? Throughout the act of writing, you will learn more about your topic. Even though some people think of writing as a way to capture a fully formed idea, writing can also be a way to process ideas--in other words, writing can be an act of thinking. It forces you to look closer and see more. Your revisions should reflect the knowledge you gain through the act of writing. You should give yourself license to fail, to an extent. If to essay is to try, then it's OK to fall short. Writing is also an iterative process, which means your first draft isn't the final product. Now, what is revision? You may have been taught that revision means fixing commas, using a thesaurus to brighten up word choice, and maybe tweaking a sentence or two. However, I prefer to think of revision as \"re | vision.\" \n#### CONCEPTS AND STRATEGIES FOR REVISION \n##### 1. Writing invites discovery. \n##### 2. An essay is an attempt, but not all attempts are successful on the first try. \n 121 A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT \nRevision isn't just about polishing--it's about seeing your piece from a new angle, with \"fresh eyes.\" Often, we get so close to our own writing that we need to be able to see it from a different perspective in order to improve it. Revision happens on many levels. What you may have been trained to think of as revision--grammatical and mechanical fixes--is just one tier. Here's how I like to imagine it: _Fig 16.1 Global revision, local revision, and proofreading_ Even though all kinds of revision are valuable, your global issues are first-order concerns, and proofreading is a last-order concern. If your entire topic, approach, or structure needs revision, it doesn't matter if you have a comma splice or two. It's likely that you'll end up rewriting that sentence anyway. There are a handful of techniques you can experiment with in order to practice true revision. First, if you can, take some time away from your writing. When you return, you will have a clearer head. You will even, in some ways, be a different person when you come back--since we as humans are constantly changing from moment to moment, day to day, you will have a different perspective with some time away. This might be one way for you to make procrastination work in your favor: if you know you struggle with procrastination, try to bust out a quick first draft the day an essay is assigned. Then you can come back to it a few hours or a few days later with fresh eyes and a clearer idea of your goals. A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 122 \nSecond, you can challenge yourself to reimagine your writing using global and local revision techniques, like those included later in this chapter. Third, you can (and should) read your paper aloud, if only to yourself. This technique distances you from your writing; by forcing yourself to read aloud, you may catch sticky spots, mechanical errors, abrupt transitions, and other mistakes you would miss if you were immersed in your writing. (Recently, a student shared with me that she uses an online text-to-speech voice reader to create this same separation. By listening along and taking notes, she can identify opportunities for localand proofreading-level revision.) Finally, and perhaps most importantly, you should rely on your _learning_ community. Because you most likely work on tight deadlines and don't always have the opportunity to take time away from our projects, you should solicit feedback from your classmates, the writing center, your instructor, your peer workshop group, or your friends and family. As readers, they have valuable insight into the rhetorical efficacy of your writing: their feedback can be useful in developing a piece that is conscious of audience. To begin setting expectations and procedures for your peer workshop, turn to the first activity in this section. Throughout this text, I have emphasized that good writing cannot exist in a vacuum; similarly, good rewriting often requires a supportive learning community. Even if you have had negative experiences with peer workshops before, I encourage you to give them another chance. Not only do professional writers consistently work with other writers, but my students are nearly always surprised by just how helpful it is to work alongside their classmates. The previous diagram (of global, local, and proofreading levels of revision) reminds us that everyone has something valuable to offer in a learning community: because there are so many different elements on which to articulate feedback, you can provide meaningful feedback to your workshop, even if you don't feel like an expert writer. During the many iterations of revising, remember to be flexible and to listen. Seeing your writing with fresh eyes requires you to step outside of yourself, figuratively. Listen actively and seek to truly understand feedback by asking clarifying questions and asking for examples. The reactions of your audience are a part of writing that you cannot overlook, so revision ought to be driven by the responses of your colleagues. On the other hand, remember that the ultimate choice to use or disregard feedback is at the author's discretion: provide all the suggestions you want as a group member, but use your best judgment as an author. If members of your group disagree--great! Contradictory feedback reminds us that writing is a dynamic, transactional action that is dependent on the specific rhetorical audience. Chapter Vocabulary 123 COLLECTED WORKS \n Table 16.1 Definitions of terms used in the following chapter \n##### Vocabulary Definition \n##### Essay \n A medium, typically nonfiction, by which an author can achieve a variety of purposes. Popularized by Michel de Montaigne as a method of discovery of knowledge: in the original French, essay is a verb that means \"to try, to test, to explore, to attempt to understand.\" \n##### Fluff \n Uneconomical writing: filler language or unnecessarily wordy phrasing. Although fluff occurs in a variety of ways, it can be generally defined as words, phrases, sentences, or paragraphs that do not work hard to help you achieve your rhetorical purpose. \n##### Iterative \n Literally a repetition within a process. The writing process is iterative because it is nonlinear and because an author often has to repeat, revisit, or reapproach different steps along the way. \n##### Learning \n##### community \n A network of learners and teachers, each equipped and empowered to provide support through horizontal power relations. Values diversity insofar as it encourages growth and perspective but also inclusivity. Also, a community that learns by adapting to its unique needs and advantages. \n##### Revision \n The iterative process of changing a piece of writing. Literally revision: seeing your writing with \"fresh eyes\" in order to improve it. Includes changes on global, local, and proofreading levels. Changes might include the following:  Rewriting (trying again, perhaps from a different angle or with a different focus)  Adding (new information, new ideas, new evidence)  Subtracting (unrelated ideas, redundant information, fluff)  Rearranging (finding more effective vectors or sequences of organization)  Switching out (changing words or phrases, substituting different evidence)  Mechanical cleanup (standardizing punctuation, grammar, or formatting) \n##### Establishing Your Peer Workshop \n Before you begin working with a group, it's important for you to establish a set of shared goals, expectations, and processes. You might spend a few minutes talking through the following questions:  Have you ever participated in a peer workshop before? What worked? What didn't?  What do you hate about group projects? How might you mitigate these issues?  What opportunities do group projects offer that working independently doesn't? What are you excited about?  What requests do you have for your peer workshop group members? \n#### REVISION ACTIVITIES \n A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 124 \n In addition to thinking through the culture you want to create for your workshop group, you should also consider the kind of feedback you want to exchange, practically speaking. In order to arrive at a shared definition for \"good feedback,\" I often ask my students to complete the following sentence as many times as possible with their groupmates: \"Good feedback is...\" The list could go on forever, but here are a few that I emphasize: Table 16.2 A set of qualities that describe good feedback \n##### \"Good feedback is...\" \nKind Actionable Not prescriptive (offers suggestions, not demands) Cognizant of process (i.e., recognizes that a first draft isn't a final draft) Respectful^ Honest Specific Comprehensive (i.e., global, local, and proofreading) Attentive Once you've discussed the parameters for the learning community you're building, you can begin workshopping your drafts, asking, \"What does the author do well and what could they do better?\" Personally, I prefer a workshop that's conversational, allowing the author and the audience to discuss the work both generally and specifically; however, your group should use whatever format will be most valuable for you. Before starting your workshop, try to get everyone on the same page logistically by using the following flowcharts. To set the tone and expectations for your unique workshop group, talk through the following prompts. Record your answers. The first activity will establish a climate or culture for your group; the second will help you talk through logistics. Choose the 3-5 descriptors of good feedback that are most important to the members of your group. Discuss for 3-5 minutes: What do each of you need for this Peer Workshop to be effective? **From each other? From the instructor? From yourselves? From your environment?** Record responses on a separate sheet of paper. 125 COLLECTED WORKS \n_Fig 16.2 Establishing your peer workshop_ A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 126 \n Fig 16.3 How will your group develop feedback? \n##### Global Revision Activity For A Narrative Essay \n This assignment challenges you to try new approaches to a draft you've already written. Although you will be \"rewriting\" in this exercise, you are not abandoning your earlier draft: this exercise is generative, meaning it is designed to help you produce new details, ideas, or surprising bits of language that you might integrate into your project. First, choose a part of your draft that (1) you really like but think could be better or (2) just isn't working for you. This excerpt should be no fewer than one hundred words and can include your entire essay, if you want. 127 COLLECTED WORKS \nThen complete your choice of one prompt from the list below: apply the instruction to the excerpt to create new content. _Read over your original once, but do not refer back to it after you start writing. Your goal here is to deviate from the first version, not reproduce it._ The idea here is to produce something new about your topic through constraint; you are reimagining your excerpt on a global scale. After completing one prompt, go back to the original and try at least one more or apply a different prompt to your new work. \n**1.** _Change genres._ For example, if your excerpt is written in typical essay form, try     writing it as poetry, or dialogue from a play/movie, or a radio advertisement </passage>"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<tool_call>\\n{\"arguments\": {\"queries\": ['How does the idea of an essay as an attempt connect to the concept of writing as an act of thinking?', 'In what ways can the iterative process of revision connect to the concept of learning and development?', 'How does the concept of \"good feedback\" connect to the idea of a learning community during the revision process?'], \"name\": \"ExpertQAExtractor\"}}\\n</tool_call>"}]}

Heavy lines indicate edges that have been (irrevocably) added to the set. \n5.2. TREES 111 \nyou think that the shortest path between any two nodes would land right on this Prim network? Yet if you compare Figure 5.14 with Figure 5.13 you'll see that the quickest way from Bordeaux to Strasbourg is through Marseille, not Vichy. \nSo we end up with the remarkable fact that the shortest route between two points has nothing whatsoever to do with the shortest _total_ distance between _all_ points. Who knew? \n**5.2 Trees** \nA tree is really nothing but a simplification of a graph. There are two kinds of trees in the world: free trees, and rooted trees.^4 \n**Free trees** \nA **free tree** is just a connected graph with no cycles. Every node is reachable from the others, and there's only one way to get anywhere. Take a look at Figure 5.15. It looks just like a graph (and it is) but unlike the WWII France graph, it's more skeletal. This is because in some sense, a free tree doesn't contain anything \"extra.\" \nIf you have a free tree, the following interesting facts are true: \n1. There's exactly one path between any two nodes. (Check it!) \n2. If you remove any edge, the graph becomes disconnected.     (Try it!) \n3. If you add any new edge, you end up adding a cycle. (Try it!) \n4. If there are n nodes, there are n - 1 edges. (Think about it!) \nSo basically, if your goal is connecting all the nodes, and you have a free tree, you're all set. Adding anything is redundant, and taking away anything breaks it. \n(^4) There appears to be no consensus as to which of these concepts is the most basic. Some authors refer to a free tree simply as a \"tree\" -- as though this were the \"normal\" kind of tree -- and use the term rooted tree for the other kind. Other authors do the opposite. To avoid confusion, I'll try to always use the full term (although I admit I'm one who considers rooted trees to be the more important, default concept). \n112 CHAPTER 5. STRUCTURES \n C \n B D \n E \n A \n F \n Figure 5.15: A free tree. \nIf this reminds you of Prim's algorithm, it should. Prim's algorithm produced exactly this: a _free tree_ connecting all the nodes -- and specifically the free tree with shortest possible total length. Go back and look at the final frame of Figure 5.14 and convince yourself that the darkened edges form a free tree. \nFor this reason, the algorithm is often called **Prim's minimal spanning tree algorithm**. A \"spanning tree\" just means \"a free tree that spans (connects) all the graph's nodes.\" \nKeep in mind that there are many free trees one can make with the same set of vertices. For instance, if you remove the edge from A to F, and add one from anything else to F, you have a different free tree. \n**Rooted trees** \nNow a **rooted tree** is the same thing as a free tree, except that we elevate one node to become the **root**. It turns out this makes all the difference. Suppose we chose A as the root of Figure 5.15. Then we would have the rooted tree in the left half of Figure 5.16. The A vertex has been positioned at the top, and everything else is flowing under it. I think of it as reaching into the free tree, carefully grasping a node, and then lifting up your hand so the rest of the free tree dangles from there. Had we chosen (say) C as the root \n5.2. TREES 113 \ninstead, we would have a different rooted tree, depicted in the right half of the figure. Both of these rooted trees have all the same edges as the free tree did: B is connected to both A and C, F is connected only to A, _etc._ The only difference is which node is designated the root. \n A \n F B \n C \n D E \n C \n B \n A \n F \n D E \nFigure 5.16: Two different rooted trees with the same vertices and edges. \nUp to now we've said that the spatial positioning on graphs is irrelevant. But this changes a bit with rooted trees. Vertical positioning is our only way of showing which nodes are \"above\" others, and the word \"above\" does indeed have meaning here: it means closer to the root. The altitude of a node shows how many steps it is away from the root. In the right rooted tree, nodes B, D, and E are all one step away from the root (C), while node F is three steps away. \nThe key aspect to rooted trees -- which is both their greatest advantage and greatest limitation -- is that _every node has one and only one path to the root._ This behavior is inherited from free trees: as we noted, every node has only one path to every other. \nTrees have a myriad of applications. Think of the files and folders on your hard drive: at the top is the root of the filesystem (perhaps \"/\" on Linux/Mac or \"C:\\\\\" on Windows) and underneath that are named folders. Each folder can contain files as well as other named folders, and so on down the hierarchy. The result is that each file has one, and only one, distinct path to it from the top of the filesystem. The file can be stored, and later retrieved, in exactly one way. \n114 CHAPTER 5. STRUCTURES \nAn \"org chart\" is like this: the CEO is at the top, then underneath her are the VP's, the Directors, the Managers, and finally the rankand-file employees. So is a military organization: the Commander in Chief directs generals, who command colonels, who command majors, who command captains, who command lieutenants, who command sergeants, who command privates. \nThe human body is even a rooted tree of sorts: it contains skeletal, cardiovascular, digestive, and other systems, each of which is comprised of organs, then tissues, then cells, molecules, and atoms. In fact, anything that has this sort of part-whole containment hierarchy is just asking to be represented as a tree. \nIn computer programming, the applications are too numerous to name. Compilers scan code and build a \"parse tree\" of its underlying meaning. HTML is a way of structuring plain text into a tree-like hierarchy of displayable elements. AI chess programs build trees representing their possible future moves and their opponent's probable responses, in order to \"see many moves ahead\" and evaluate their best options. Object-oriented designs involve \"inheritance hierarchies\" of classes, each one specialized from a specific other. _Etc._ Other than a simple sequence (like an array), trees are probably the most common data structure in all of computer science. \n**Rooted tree terminology** \nRooted trees carry with them a number of terms. I'll use the tree on the left side of Figure 5.16 as an illustration of each: \n**root.** The node at the top of the tree, which is A in our example. Note that unlike trees in the real world, computer science trees have their root at the top and grow down. Every tree has a root except the **empty tree** , which is the \"tree\" that has no nodes at all in it.

So you will make the decision to set daily fancy mix production at f = 825. This has the effect of setting b = 4(825) - 3300 = 0 and we stop producing bulk mix entirely. So the remainder of your daily production is standard mix at the level of s = -5(825) + 4800 = 675 kilograms and the resulting daily profit is (- 1 .04)(825) + 3663 = 2805. It is a pleasant surprise that daily profit has risen to $2,805, but this is not the most important part of the story. What is important here is that there are a large number of ways to produce trail mix that use all of the day's worth of raw ingredients and you were able to easily choose the one that netted the largest profit. Notice too how all of the above computations look \"linear.\" In the food industry, things do not stay the same for long, and now the sales department says that increased competition has led to the decision to stay competitive and charge just $5.25 for a kilogram of the standard mix, rather than the previous $5.50 per kilogram. This decision has no effect on the possibilities for the production schedule, but will affect the decision based on profit considerations. So you revisit just the profit computation, suitably adjusted for the new selling price of standard mix, \n(4f - 3300)(4. 99 - 3 .70) + (- 5 f + 4800)(5. 25 - 3 .85) + (f )(6. 50 - 4 .45) = 0. 21 f + 2463 Now it would appear that fancy mix is beneficial to the company's profit since the value of f has a positive coefficient. So you take the decision to make as much fancy mix as possible, setting f = 960. This leads to s = -5(960) + 4800 = 0 and the increased competition has driven you out of the standard mix market all together. The remainder of production is therefore bulk mix at a daily level of b = 4(960) - 3300 = 540 kilograms and the resulting daily profit is 0.21(960) + 2463 = 2664.60. A daily profit of $2,664.60 is less than it used to be, but as production manager, you have made the best of a difficult situation and shown the sales department that the best course is to pull out of the highly competitive standard mix market completely. 4 \nThis example is taken from a field of mathematics variously known by names such as operations research, systems science, or management science. More specifically, this is a prototypical example of problems that are solved by the techniques of \"linear programming.\" There is a lot going on under the hood in this example. The heart of the matter is the solution to systems of linear equations, which is the topic of the next few sections, and a recurrent theme throughout this course. We will return to this example on several occasions to reveal some of the reasons for its behavior. \n##### Reading Questions \n1. Is the equation x^2 + xy + tan(y^3 ) = 0 linear or not? Why or why not? \n2. Find all solutions to the system of two linear equations 2x + 3y = -8, x - y = 6. \n3.

For example, it costs $3.69 to make one kilogram of the bulk variety. Re-compute each of these three costs and notice that the computations are linear in character. \nM70+^ In Example TMP two different prices were considered for marketing standard mix with the revised recipes (one-third peanuts in each recipe). Selling standard mix at $5.50 resulted in selling the minimum amount of the fancy mix and no bulk mix. At $5.25 it was best for profits to sell the maximum amount of fancy mix and then sell no standard mix. Determine a selling price for standard mix that allows for maximum profits while still selling some of each type of mix. \n### Section SSLE \n### Solving Systems of Linear Equations \n We will motivate our study of linear algebra by considering the problem of solving several linear equations simultaneously. The word \"solve\" tends to get abused somewhat, as in \"solve this problem.\" When talking about equations we understand a more precise meaning: find all of the values of some variable quantities that make an equation, or several equations, simultaneously true. \n##### Subsection SLE \n##### Systems of Linear Equations \n Our first example is of a type we will not pursue further. While it has two equations, the first is not linear. So this is a good example to come back to later, especially after you have seen Theorem PSSLS. Example STNE Solving two (nonlinear) equations Suppose we desire the simultaneous solutions of the two equations, x^2 + y^2 = 1 -x + \n  3 y = 0 \n You can easily check by substitution that x = \n  3 2 , y^ =^ \n 1 2 and^ x^ =^ -^ \n  3 2 , y^ =^ -^ \n 1 2 are both solutions. We need to also convince ourselves that these are the only solutions. To see this, plot each equation on the xy-plane, which means to plot (x, y) pairs that make an individual equation true. In this case we get a circle centered at the origin with radius 1 and a straight line through the origin with slope ^13. The intersections of these two curves are our desired simultaneous solutions, and so we believe from our plot that the two solutions we know already are indeed the only ones. We like to write solutions as sets, so in this case we write the set of solutions as \n S = \n{( (^)  3 2 ,^ 1 2 ) , ( -  3 2 ,^ -^ 1 2 )} 4 In order to discuss systems of linear equations carefully, we need a precise definition. And before we do that, we will introduce our periodic discussions about \"Proof Techniques.\" Linear algebra is an excellent setting for learning how to read, understand and formulate proofs. But this is a difficult step in your development as a mathematician, so we have included a series of short essays containing advice and explanations to help you along. These will be referenced in the text as needed, and are also collected as a list you can consult when you want to return to re-read them. (Which is strongly encouraged!) With a definition next, now is the time for the first of our proof techniques. So study Proof Technique D. We'll be right here when you get back. See you in a bit. Definition SLE System of Linear Equations A system of linear equations is a collection of m equations in the variable quantities x 1 , x 2 , x 3 ,... , xn of the form, a 11 x 1 + a 12 x 2 + a 13 x 3 + * * * + a 1 nxn = b 1 a 21 x 1 + a 22 x 2 + a 23 x 3 + * * * + a 2 nxn = b 2 a 31 x 1 + a 32 x 2 + a 33 x 3 + * * * + a 3 nxn = b 3 .. . \n SSS S L E B e e z e r : A F i r s t C o u r s e i n L i n e a r A l g e b r a 8 \nam 1 x 1 + am 2 x 2 + am 3 x 3 + * * * + amnxn = bm where the values of aij , bi and xj , 1 <= i <= m, 1 <= j <= n, are from the set of complex numbers, C. \u0003 Do not let the mention of the complex numbers, C, rattle you. We will stick with real numbers exclusively for many more sections, and it will sometimes seem like we only work with integers! However, we want to leave the possibility of complex numbers open, and there will be occasions in subsequent sections where they are necessary. You can review the basic properties of complex numbers in Section CNO, but these facts will not be critical until we reach Section O. Now we make the notion of a solution to a linear system precise. Definition SSLE Solution of a System of Linear Equations A solution of a system of linear equations in n variables, x 1 , x 2 , x 3 ,... , xn (such as the system given in Definition SLE), is an ordered list of n complex numbers, s 1 , s 2 , s 3 ,... , sn such that if we substitute s 1 for x 1 , s 2 for x 2 , s 3 for x 3 ,... , sn for xn, then for every equation of the system the left side will equal the right side, i.e. each equation is true simultaneously. \u0003 More typically, we will write a solution in a form like x 1 = 12, x 2 = -7, x 3 = 2 to mean that s 1 = 12, s 2 = -7, s 3 = 2 in the notation of Definition SSLE. To discuss all of the possible solutions to a system of linear equations, we now define the set of all solutions. (So Section SET is now applicable, and you may want to go and familiarize yourself with what is there.) Definition SSSLE Solution Set of a System of Linear Equations The solution set of a linear system of equations is the set which contains every solution to the system, and nothing more. \u0003 Be aware that a solution set can be infinite, or there can be no solutions, in which case we write the solution set as the empty set,  = {} (Definition ES). Here is an example to illustrate using the notation introduced in Definition SLE and the notion of a solution (Definition SSLE). Example NSE Notation for a system of equations Given the system of linear equations, x 1 + 2x 2 + x 4 = 7 x 1 + x 2 + x 3 - x 4 = 3 3 x 1 + x 2 + 5x 3 - 7 x 4 = 1 we have n = 4 variables and m = 3 equations. Also, a 11 = 1 a 12 = 2 a 13 = 0 a 14 = 1 b 1 = 7 a 21 = 1 a 22 = 1 a 23 = 1 a 24 = - 1 b 2 = 3 a 31 = 3 a 32 = 1 a 33 = 5 a 34 = - 7 b 3 = 1 Additionally, convince yourself that x 1 = -2, x 2 = 4, x 3 = 2, x 4 = 1 is one solution (Definition SSLE), but it is not the only one! For example, another solution is x 1 = -12, x 2 = 11, x 3 = 1, x 4 = -3, and there are more to be found. So the solution set contains at least two elements. 4 We will often shorten the term \"system of linear equations\" to \"system of equations\" leaving the linear aspect implied. After all, this is a book about linear algebra. \n SSS S L E B e e z e r : A F i r s t C o u r s e i n L i n e a r A l g e b r a 9 \n##### Subsection PSS \n##### Possibilities for Solution Sets \nThe next example illustrates the possibilities for the solution set of a system of linear equations. We will not be too formal here, and the necessary theorems to back up our claims will come in subsequent sections. So read for feeling and come back later to revisit this example. Example TTS Three typical systems Consider the system of two equations with two variables, 2 x 1 + 3x 2 = 3 x 1 - x 2 = 4 If we plot the solutions to each of these equations separately on the x 1 x 2 -plane, we get two lines, one with negative slope, the other with positive slope. They have exactly one point in common, (x 1 , x 2 ) = (3, -1), which is the solution x 1 = 3, x 2 = -1. From the geometry, we believe that this is the only solution to the system of equations, and so we say it is unique. Now adjust the system with a different second equation, 2 x 1 + 3x 2 = 3 4 x 1 + 6x 2 = 6 A plot of the solutions to these equations individually results in two lines, one on top of the other! There are infinitely many pairs of points that make both equations true. We will learn shortly how to describe this infinite solution set precisely (see Example SAA, Theorem VFSLS). Notice now how the second equation is just a multiple of the first.

(255) A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 8 \n Don't be scared whenever you are given an assignment. Professors know what it was like to be in college and write all kinds of papers. They aren't trying to make your lives difficult, but it is their job to make us think and ponder about many things. Take your time and enjoy the paper. Make sure you answer the question being asked rather than rant on about something that is irrelevant to the prompt. TIMOTHEE PIZARRO writing student discussion question, blog post, essay exam, project proposal, or what have you--is ultimately about your learning. To succeed with writing assignments (and benefit from them), you first have to understand their learning-related purposes. As you write for the hypothetical audience of peer junior scholars, you're demonstrating to your professor how far you've gotten in analyzing your topic. Instructors don't assign writing lightly. Grading student writing is generally the hardest, most intensive work instructors do. You would do well to approach every assignment by putting yourself in the shoes of your instructor and asking yourself, \"Why did they give me this assignment? How does it fit into the learning goals of the course? Why is this question/topic/problem so important to my instructor that they are willing to spend evenings and weekends reading and commenting on several dozen papers on it?\" Most instructors do a lot to make their pedagogical goals and expectations transparent to students: they explain the course learning goals associated with assignments, provide grading rubrics in advance, and describe several strategies for succeeding. Other instructors...not so much. Some students perceive more open-ended assignments as evidence of a lazy, uncaring, or even incompetent instructor. Not so fast! Instructors certainly vary in the quantity and specificity of the guidelines and suggestions they distribute with each writing assignment. It is understandably frustrating when you feel you don't know how to direct your efforts to succeed with an assignment. However, except for rare egregious situations, you would do well to assume the best of your instructor and to appreciate the diversity of learning opportunities you have access to in college. Like one first-year student told Keith Hjortshoj, \"I think that every course, every assignment, is a different little puzzle I have to solve. What do I need to do here? When do I need to do it, and how long will it take? What does this teacher expect of me?\" (4). The transparency that you get from some professors--along with guides like this one--will be a big help to you in situations where you have to be scrappier and more proactive, piecing together the clues you get from your professors, the readings, and other course documents. \n##### The Prompt: What Does \"Analyze\" Mean Anyway? \n Often, the handout or other written text explaining the assignment--what instructors call the assignment prompt--will explain the purpose of the assignment, the required parameters (length, number and type of sources, referencing style, etc.), and the criteria for evaluation. Sometimes, though--especially when you are new to a field--you will encounter the baffling situation in which you comprehend every single sentence in the prompt but still have absolutely no idea how to approach the assignment. No one is doing anything wrong in a situation like that. It just means that further discussion of the assignment is in order. Here are some tips: 9 COLLECTED WORKS \n Look for verbs like \"compare,\" \"explain,\" \"justify,\" \"reflect,\" or the all-purpose \"analyze.\" You're not just producing a paper as an artifact; you're conveying, in written communication, some intellectual work you have done. So the question is, What kind of thinking are you supposed to do to deepen your learning? Many professors think in terms of assignment sequences. For example, a social science professor may ask you to write about a controversial issue three times: first, arguing for one side of the debate; second, arguing for another; and finally, arguing from a more comprehensive and nuanced perspective, incorporating text produced in the first two assignments. A sequence like that is designed to help you think through a complex issue. Another common one is a scaffolded research paper sequence: you first propose a topic, then prepare an annotated bibliography, then make the first draft, then make the final draft, and finally, perhaps, create a reflective paper. The preparatory assignments help ensure that you're on the right track, beginning the research process long before the final due date and taking the time to consider recasting your thesis, finding additional sources, or reorganizing your discussion. (Most instructors are perpetually frustrated with the \"one-and-done\" attitude that most students bring to their work, and some sequences are specifically designed to force you to really rethink your conclusions.) If the assignment isn't part of a sequence, think about where it falls in the semester and how it relates to readings and other assignments. Are there headings on the syllabus that indicate larger units of material? For example, if you see that a paper comes at the end of a three-week unit on the role of the internet in organizational behavior, then your professor likely wants you to synthesize that material in your own way. You should also check your notes and online course resources for any other guidelines about the workflow. Maybe you got a rubric a couple of weeks ago and forgot about it. Maybe your instructor posted a link about \"how to make an annotated bibliography\" but then forgot to mention it in class. When I hand out an assignment, I often ask students to do a five-minute or tenminute freewrite. A freewrite is when you just write, without stopping, for a set period of time. That doesn't sound very \"free\"; it actually sounds kind of coerced. The \"free\" part is what you write--it can be whatever comes to mind. Professional writers use freewriting to get started on a challenging (or distasteful) writing task or to overcome writer's block or a powerful urge to procrastinate. The idea is that if you just make yourself write, you can't help but produce some kind of useful nugget. Thus, even if the first eight sentences of your freewrite are all variations on \"I don't understand this\" or \"I'd really rather be doing something else,\" eventually you'll write something like \"I guess the main point of this is...\" and--booyah!--you're off and running. As an instructor, I've found that asking students to do a brief freewrite right after I hand out an assignment generates useful clarification questions. If your \n##### Focus on the verbs \n##### Put the assignment in context \n##### Try a freewrite \n A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 10 \n instructor doesn't make time for that in class, a quick freewrite on your own will quickly reveal whether you need clarification about the assignment and, often, what questions to ask. Even the most skillfully crafted assignments may need some verbal clarification, especially because students' familiarity with the field can vary enormously. Asking for clarification is a good thing. Be aware, though, that instructors get frustrated when they perceive that students want to skip doing their own thinking and instead receive an exact recipe for an A paper. Go ahead and ask for clarification, but try to convey that you want to learn and you're ready to work. In general, avoid starting a question with \"Do we have to...\" because I can guarantee that your instructor is thinking, \"You don't have to do anything. You're an adult. You chose college. You chose this class. You're free to exercise your right to fail.\" Similarly, avoid asking the professor about what he or she \"wants.\" You're not performing some service for the instructor when you write a paper. What they \"want\" is for you to really think about the material. Table 2.1 Suggested alternatives to frequently asked (and potentially annoying) questions \n##### Potentially annoying \n##### questions \n##### Preferable alternatives \n##### \"I don't get it. Can you \n##### explain this more?\" or \n##### \"What do you want us \n##### to do?\" \n \"I see that we are comparing and contrasting these two cases. What should be our focus? Their causes? Their impacts? Their implications? All of those things?\" or \"I'm unfamiliar with how art historians analyze a painting. Could you say more about what questions I should have in mind to do this kind of analysis?\" \n##### \"How many sources do \n##### we have to cite?\" \n \"Is there a typical range for the number of sources a well-written paper would cite for this assignment?\" or \"Could you say more about what the sources are for? Is it more that we're analyzing these texts in this paper, or are we using these texts to analyze some other case?\" \n##### \"What do I have to do \n##### to get an A on this \n##### paper?\" \n \"Could I meet with you to get feedback on my (preprepared) plans/outline/thesis/draft?\" or \"I'm not sure how to approach this assignment. Are there any good examples or resources you could point me to?\" If an instructor provides a grading rubric with an assignment prompt, you can be sure that he or she will use it to grade your paper. He or she may not go over it in class, but it's the clearest possible statement of what the professor is looking for in the paper. If it's wordy, it may seem like those online \"terms and conditions\" that we routinely accept without reading. But you really should read it over carefully before you begin and again as your work progresses. A lot of rubrics do have some useful specifics. Mine, for example, often contain phrases like \"makes at least six error-free connections to concepts or ideas from the course\" or \"gives thorough consideration to at least one plausible counterargument.\" Even less specific criteria (such as \"incorporates course concepts\" and \"considers counterarguments\") will tell you how you should be spending your writing time. \n##### Ask for clarification the right way. \n#### RUBRICS AS ROAD MAPS \n 11 COLLECTED WORKS \n Even the best rubrics aren't completely transparent. They simply can't be. Take, for example, the Association of American Colleges and Universities (AAC&U) rubric. It has been drafted and repeatedly revised by a multidisciplinary expert panel and tested multiple times on sample student work to ensure reliability. But it still seems kind of vague. What is the real difference between \"demonstrating a thorough understanding of context, audience, and purpose\" and \"demonstrating adequate consideration\" of the same? It depends on the specific context. So how can you know whether you've done that? A big part of what you're learning, through feedback from your professors, is to judge the quality of your writing for yourself. Your future bosses are counting on that. At this point, it is better to think of rubrics as road maps displaying your destination rather than GPS systems directing every move you make. Behind any rubric is the essential goal of higher education: helping you take charge of your own learning, which means writing like an independently motivated scholar. Are you tasked with proposing a research paper topic? Don't just tell the professor what you want to do; convince him or her of the salience of your topic as if you were a scholar seeking grant money. Is it a reflection paper? Then outline both the insights you've gained and the intriguing questions that remain, as a scholar would. Are you writing a thesis-driven analytical paper? Then apply the concepts you've learned to a new problem or situation. Write as if your scholarly peers around the country are eagerly awaiting your unique insights. Descriptors like \"thoroughness\" or \"mastery\" or \"detailed attention\" convey the vision of student writers making the time and rigorous mental effort to offer something new to the ongoing, multistranded academic conversation. What your professor wants, in short, is critical thinking. Critical thinking is one of those terms that has been used so often and in so many different ways that it often seems meaningless. It also makes one wonder, is there such a thing as uncritical thinking? If you aren't thinking critically, then are you even thinking? Despite the prevalent ambiguities, critical thinking actually does mean something. The Association of American Colleges and Universities (AAC&U) usefully defines it as \"a habit of mind characterized by the comprehensive exploration of issues, ideas, artifacts, and events before accepting or formulating an opinion or conclusion\" (\"Value Rubrics\"). That definition aligns with the best description of critical thinking I ever heard; it came from my junior high art teacher, Joe Bolger. He once asked us, \"What color is the ceiling?\" In that withering tween tone, we reluctantly replied, \"White.\" He then asked, \"What color is it really?\" We deigned to aim our preadolescent eyes upward and eventually began to offer more accurate answers: \"Ivory?\" \"Yellowish tan.\" \"It's gray in that corner.\" After finally getting a few thoughtful responses, Mr. Bolger said something like, \"Making good art is about drawing what you see, not what you think you're supposed to see.\" The AAC&U definition above essentially amounts to the same thing: taking a good look and deciding what you really think rather than relying on the first idea or assumption that comes to mind. The critical thinking rubric produced by the AAC&U describes the relevant activities of critical thinking in more detail. To think critically, you need to establish the question or problem, evaluate your sources, interrogate the assumptions informing the ideas you encounter, and develop a nuanced position that accounts for multiple perspectives (\"Value Rubrics\"). \n#### WHAT'S CRITICAL ABOUT CRITICAL THINKING? \n A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 12 \nWhile you are probably used to providing some evidence for your claims, you can see that college-level expectations go quite a bit further. When professors assign an analytical paper, they don't just want you to formulate a plausible-sounding argument. They want you to dig into the evidence, think hard about unspoken assumptions and the influence of context, and then explain what you really think and why. Interestingly, the AAC&U defines critical thinking as a \"habit of mind\" rather than a discrete achievement. And there are at least two reasons to see critical thinking as a craft or art to pursue rather than a task to check off.

Although you will be \"rewriting\" in this exercise, you are not abandoning your earlier draft: this exercise is generative, meaning it is designed to help you produce new details, ideas, or surprising bits of language that you might integrate into your project. First, choose a part of your draft that (1) you really like but think could be better or (2) just isn't working for you. This excerpt should be no fewer than one hundred words and can include your entire essay, if you want. 127 COLLECTED WORKS \nThen complete your choice of one prompt from the list below: apply the instruction to the excerpt to create new content. _Read over your original once, but do not refer back to it after you start writing. Your goal here is to deviate from the first version, not reproduce it._ The idea here is to produce something new about your topic through constraint; you are reimagining your excerpt on a global scale. After completing one prompt, go back to the original and try at least one more or apply a different prompt to your new work. \n**1.** _Change genres._ For example, if your excerpt is written in typical essay form, try     writing it as poetry, or dialogue from a play/movie, or a radio advertisement. \n**2.** _Zoom in._ Focus on one image, color, idea, or word from your excerpt and     zoom way in. Meditate on this one thing with as much detail as possible. \n**3.** _Zoom out._ Step back from the excerpt and contextualize it with background     information, concurrent events, or information about relationships or     feelings. \n**4.** _Change point of view._ Try a new vantage point for your story by changing     pronouns and perspective. For instance, if your excerpt is in first person (I/     me), switch to second (you) or third person (he/she/they). \n**5.** _Change setting._ Resituate your excerpt in a different place or time. \n**6.** _Change your audience._ Rewrite the excerpt anticipating the expectations of a     different reader than you first intended. For example, if the original excerpt is     in the same speaking voice you would use with your friends, write as if your     strictest teacher or the president or your grandmother is reading it. If you've     written in an \"academic\" voice, try writing for your closest friend--use slang,     swear words, casual language, whatever. \n**7.** _Add another voice._ Instead of just the speaker of the essay narrating, add a     listener. This listener can agree, disagree, question, heckle, sympathize,     apologize, or respond in any other way you can imagine. \n**8.** _Change timeline (narrative sequence)._ Instead of moving chronologically     forward, rearrange the events to bounce around. \n**9.** _Change tense._ Narrate from a different vantage point by changing the     grammar. For example, instead of writing in past tense, write in present or     future tense. \n**10.** _Change tone._ Reimagine your writing in a different emotional register. For     instance, if your writing is predominantly nostalgic, try a bitter tone. If you     seem regretful, try to write as if you were proud.        A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 128 \n##### Reverse Outlining \n Have you ever written an outline before writing a draft? It can be a useful prewriting strategy, but it doesn't work for all writers. If you're like me, you prefer to brain-dump a bunch of ideas on the paper, then come back to organize and refocus during the revision process. One strategy that can help you here is reverse outlining. Divide a blank piece of paper into three columns, as demonstrated below. Number each paragraph of your draft, and write an equal numbered list down the left column of your blank piece of paper. Write \"Idea\" at the top of the middle column and \"Purpose\" at the top of the right column. Table 16.3 A worksheet example for reverse formatting \n##### Paragraph Number (P#) \n##### Idea \n##### (What is the P saying?) \n##### Purpose \n##### (What is the P doing?) \n##### Paragraph 1 Notes:^ Notes: \n##### Paragraph 2 Notes:^ Notes: \n##### Paragraph 3 Notes:^ Notes: \n##### Paragraph 4 Notes:^ Notes: \n##### Paragraph 5 Notes:^ Notes: \n##### Paragraph 6 Notes:^ Notes: \n##### Paragraph 7 Notes:^ Notes: \n Now wade back through your essay, identifying what each paragraph is saying and what each paragraph is doing. Choose a few key words or phrases for each column to record on your sheet of paper.  Try to use consistent language throughout the reverse outline so you can see where your paragraphs are saying or doing similar things.  A paragraph might have too many different ideas or too many different functions for you to concisely identify. This could be a sign that you need to divide that paragraph up. Here's a student's model reverse outline: 129 COLLECTED WORKS \n Table 16.4 A model of a reverse outline \n##### Paragraph \n##### Number (P) \n##### Idea \n##### (What is the P saying?) \n##### Purpose \n##### (What is the P doing?) \n##### Paragraph 1 \n Theater is an important part of education and childhood development.

Call to action, backing up and restating thesis But wait--there's more! Once you have identified the idea(s) and purpose(s) of each paragraph, you can start revising according to your observations. From the completed reverse outline, create a new outline with a different sequence, organization, focus, or balance. You can reorganize by  combining or dividing paragraphs,  rearranging ideas, and  adding or subtracting content. Reverse outlining can also be helpful in identifying gaps and redundancies: Now that you have a new outline, do any of your ideas seem too brief? Do you need more evidence for a certain argument? Do you see ideas repeated more than necessary? After completing the reverse outline above, the student proposed this new organization: 16.5 Student proposed changes based on previous table \n##### Proposed changes based on reverse outline: \n 1 4a 4b Combine 2 and 5a Combine 3 and 6 5b Write new paragraph on other solutions 7 You might note that this strategy can also be applied on the sentence and section level. Additionally, if you are a kinesthetic or visual learner, you might cut your paper into smaller pieces that you can physically manipulate. A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 130 \n Be sure to read aloud after reverse outlining to look for abrupt transitions. You can see a simplified version of this technique demonstrated in this video. \n##### Local Revision Activity: Cutting Fluff \n When it's late at night, the deadline is approaching, and we've simply run out of things to say...we turn to fluff. Fluff refers to language that doesn't do work for you--language that simply takes up space or sits flat on the page rather than working economically and impactfully. Whether or not you've used it deliberately, all authors have been guilty of fluffy writing at one time or another. Example of fluff on social media [\"Presidents don't have to be smart\" from funnyjunk.com]. Fluff happens for a lot of reasons.  Of course, reaching a word or page count is the most common motivation.  Introductions and conclusions are often fluffy because the author can't find a way into or out of the subject or because the author doesn't know what their exact subject will be.  Sometimes, the presence of fluff is an indication that the author doesn't know enough about the subject or that their scope is too broad.  Other times, fluffy language is deployed in an effort to sound \"smarter\" or \"fancier\" or \"more academic\"--which is an understandable pitfall for developing writers. These circumstances, plus others, encourage us to use language that's not as effective, authentic, or economical. Fluff happens in a lot of ways; here are a few I've noticed: 131 COLLECTED WORKS \n Table 16.6 A list of common fluff origin stories \n##### Fluff's \n##### Supervillainous \n##### Alter-Ego \n##### Supervillain Origin Story \n##### Thesaurus \n##### syndrome \n A writer uses inappropriately complex language (often because of the right-click \"Synonyms\" function) to achieve a different tone. The more complex language might be used inaccurately or sound inauthentic because the author isn't as familiar with it. \n##### Roundabout \n##### phrasing \n Rather than making a direct statement (\"That man is a fool.\"), the author uses couching language or beats around the bush (\"If one takes into account each event, each decision, it would not be unwise for one to suggest that that man's behaviors are what some would call foolish.\") \n##### Abstraction or \n##### generalities \n If the author hasn't quite figured out what they want to say or has too broad of a scope, they might discuss an issue very generally without committing to specific, engaging details. \n##### Digression \n An author might get off topic, accidentally or deliberately, creating extraneous, irrelevant, or unconnected language. \n##### Ornamentation \n##### or flowery \n##### language \n Similarly to thesaurus syndrome, often referred to as \"purple prose,\" an author might choose words that sound pretty or smart but aren't necessarily the right words for their ideas. \n##### Wordy \n##### sentences \n Even if the sentences an author creates are grammatically correct, they might be wordier than necessary. Of course, there's a very fine line between detail and fluff. Avoiding fluff doesn't mean always using the fewest words possible. Instead, you should occasionally ask yourself in the revision process, How is this part contributing to the whole? Is this somehow building toward a bigger purpose? If the answer is no, then you need to revise. The goal should not necessarily be \"Don't write fluff\" but rather \"Learn to get rid of fluff in revision.\" In light of our focus on process, you are allowed to write fluff in the drafting period, so long as you learn to \"prune\" during revisions. (I use the word prune as an analogy for caring for a plant: just as you must cut the dead leaves off for the plant's health and growth, you will need to cut fluff so your writing can thrive.) Here are a few strategies:  Read out loud.  Ask yourself what a sentence is doing, rhetorically.  Combine like sentences, phrases, or ideas.  Use signposts, like topic-transition sentences (for yourself during revision and for your reader in the final draft).  Be specific--stay cognizant of your scope (globally) and the detail of your writing (locally). To practice revising for fluff, workshop the following excerpt by yourself or with a partner. Your goal is not to cut back to the smallest number of words but rather to prune out what you consider to be fluff and leave what you consider to be detail. You should be able to explain the choices you make.

There was a time long before today when an event occurred involving a young woman who was known to the world as Goldilocks. On the particular day at hand, Goldilocks made a spontaneous decision to wander through the forest, the trees growing up high above her flowing blonde pigtails. Some time after she commenced her voyage, but not after too long, she saw sitting on the horizon a small residency. Goldilocks rapped her knuckles on the door, but alas, no one answered the door. Therefore, Goldilocks decided that it would be a good idea to enter the unattended house, so she entered it. Atop the average-sized table in the kitchen of the house, there were three bowls of porridge, which is similar to oatmeal. Porridge is a very common dish in Europe; in fact, the Queen of England is well known for enjoying at least one daily bowl of porridge per day. Goldilocks, not unlike the Queen of England, enjoys eating porridge for its nutritional value. On this day, she was feeling quite hungry and wanted to eat. She decided that she should taste one of the three bowls of porridge, from which steam was rising indicating its temperature. But because she apparently couldn't tell, she imbibed a spoonful of the porridge </passage>"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<tool_call>\\n{\"arguments\": {\"queries\": ['What is the best approach to revising for fluff in writing?', 'How can reverse outlining be incorporated into the revision process effectively?', 'What advice would you give to someone struggling with avoiding fluff in their writing?'], \"name\": \"ExpertQAExtractor\"}}\\n</tool_call>"}]}

You have probably heard the word \"algebra\" frequently in your mathematical preparation for this course. Most likely, you have spent a good ten to fifteen years learning the algebra of the real numbers, along with some introduction to the very similar algebra of complex numbers (see Section CNO). However, there are many new algebras to learn and use, and likely linear algebra will be your second algebra. Like learning a second language, the necessary adjustments can be challenging at times, but the rewards are many. And it will make learning your third and fourth algebras even easier. Perhaps you have heard of \"groups\" and \"rings\" (or maybe you have studied them already), which are excellent examples of other algebras with very interesting properties and applications. In any event, prepare yourself to learn a new algebra and realize that some of the old rules you used for the real numbers may no longer apply to this new algebra you will be learning! The brief discussion above about lines and planes suggests that linear algebra has an inherently geometric nature, and this is true. Examples in two and three dimensions can be used to provide valuable insight into important concepts of this course. However, much of the power of linear algebra will be the ability to work with \"flat\" or \"straight\" objects in higher dimensions, without concerning ourselves with visualizing the situation. While much of our intuition will come from examples in two and three dimensions, we will maintain an algebraic approach to the subject, with the geometry being secondary. Others may wish to switch this emphasis around, and that can lead to a very fruitful and beneficial course, but here and now we are laying our bias bare. \n##### Subsection AA \n##### An Application \n We conclude this section with a rather involved example that will highlight some of the power and techniques of linear algebra. Work through all of the details with pencil and paper, until you believe all the assertions made. However, in this introductory example, do not concern yourself with how some of the results are obtained or how you might be expected to solve a similar problem. We will come back to this example later and expose some of the techniques used and properties exploited. For now, use your background in mathematics to convince yourself that everything said here really is correct. Example TMP Trail Mix Packaging Suppose you are the production manager at a food-packaging plant and one of your product lines is trail mix, a healthy snack popular with hikers and backpackers, containing raisins, peanuts and hard-shelled chocolate pieces. By adjusting the mix of these three ingredients, you are able to sell three varieties of this item. The fancy version is sold in half-kilogram packages at outdoor supply stores and has more chocolate and fewer raisins, thus commanding a higher price. The standard version is sold in one kilogram packages in grocery stores and gas station mini-markets. Since the standard version has roughly equal amounts of each ingredient, it is not as expensive as the fancy version. Finally, a bulk version is sold in bins at grocery stores for consumers to load into plastic bags in amounts of their choosing. To appeal to the shoppers that like bulk items for their economy and healthfulness, this mix has many more raisins (at the expense of chocolate) and therefore sells for less. Your production facilities have limited storage space and early each morning you are able to receive and store 380 kilograms of raisins, 500 kilograms of peanuts and 620 kilograms of chocolate pieces. As production manager, one of your most important duties is to decide how much of each version of trail mix to make every day. Clearly, you can have up to 1500 kilograms of raw ingredients available each day, so to be the most productive you will likely produce 1500 kilograms of trail \nSSW I L A B e e z e r : A F i r s t C o u r s e i n L i n e a r A l g e b r a 3 \nmix each day. Also, you would prefer not to have any ingredients leftover each day, so that your final product is as fresh as possible and so that you can receive the maximum delivery the next morning. But how should these ingredients be allocated to the mixing of the bulk, standard and fancy versions? First, we need a little more information about the mixes. Workers mix the ingredients in 15 kilogram batches, and each row of the table below gives a recipe for a 15 kilogram batch. There is some additional information on the costs of the ingredients and the price the manufacturer can charge for the different versions of the trail mix. \n Raisins Peanuts Chocolate Cost Sale Price (kg/batch) (kg/batch) (kg/batch) ($/kg) ($/kg) Bulk 7 6 2 3.69 4.99 Standard 6 4 5 3.86 5.50 Fancy 2 5 8 4.45 6.50 Storage (kg) 380 500 620 Cost ($/kg) 2.55 4.65 4.80 \nAs production manager, it is important to realize that you only have three decisions to make -- the amount of bulk mix to make, the amount of standard mix to make and the amount of fancy mix to make. Everything else is beyond your control or is handled by another department within the company. Principally, you are also limited by the amount of raw ingredients you can store each day. Let us denote the amount of each mix to produce each day, measured in kilograms, by the variable quantities b, s and f. Your production schedule can be described as values of b, s and f that do several things. First, we cannot make negative quantities of each mix, so \nb >= 0 s >= 0 f >= 0 Second, if we want to consume all of our ingredients each day, the storage capacities lead to three (linear) equations, one for each ingredient, \n 7 15 \n b + 6 15 \n s + 2 15 \n f = 380 (raisins) 6 15 \n b + 4 15 \n s + 5 15 \n f = 500 (peanuts) 2 15 \n b + 5 15 \n s + 8 15 \n f = 620 (chocolate) \nIt happens that this system of three equations has just one solution. In other words, as production manager, your job is easy, since there is but one way to use up all of your raw ingredients making trail mix. This single solution is \nb = 300 kg s = 300 kg f = 900 kg. We do not yet have the tools to explain why this solution is the only one, but it should be simple for you to verify that this is indeed a solution. (Go ahead, we will wait.) Determining solutions such as this, and establishing that they are unique, will be the main motivation for our initial study of linear algebra. So we have solved the problem of making sure that we make the best use of our limited storage space, and each day use up all of the raw ingredients that are shipped to us. Additionally, as production manager, you must report weekly to the CEO of the company, and you know he will be more interested in the profit derived from your decisions than in the actual production levels. So you compute, \n 300(4. 99 - 3 .69) + 300(5. 50 - 3 .86) + 900(6. 50 - 4 .45) = 2727. 00 \nfor a daily profit of $2,727 from this production schedule. The computation of the daily profit is also beyond our control, though it is definitely of interest, and it too looks like a \"linear\" computation. \nSSW I L A B e e z e r : A F i r s t C o u r s e i n L i n e a r A l g e b r a 4 \nAs often happens, things do not stay the same for long, and now the marketing department has suggested that your company's trail mix products standardize on every mix being one-third peanuts. Adjusting the peanut portion of each recipe by also adjusting the chocolate portion leads to revised recipes, and slightly different costs for the bulk and standard mixes, as given in the following table. \n Raisins Peanuts Chocolate Cost Sale Price (kg/batch) (kg/batch) (kg/batch) ($/kg) ($/kg) Bulk 7 5 3 3.70 4.99 Standard 6 5 4 3.85 5.50 Fancy 2 5 8 4.45 6.50 Storage (kg) 380 500 620 Cost ($/kg) 2.55 4.65 4.80 In a similar fashion as before, we desire values of b, s and f so that b >= 0 s >= 0 f >= 0 \nand 7 15 \n b + 6 15 \n s + 2 15 \n f = 380 (raisins) 5 15 \n b + 5 15 \n s + 5 15 \n f = 500 (peanuts) 3 15 \n b + 4 15 \n s + 8 15 \n f = 620 (chocolate) \nIt now happens that this system of equations has infinitely many solutions, as we will now demonstrate. Let f remain a variable quantity. Then if we make f kilograms of the fancy mix, we will make 4f - 3300 kilograms of the bulk mix and - 5 f + 4800 kilograms of the standard mix. Let us now verify that, for any choice of f , the values of b = 4f - 3300 and s = - 5 f + 4800 will yield a production schedule that exhausts all of the day's supply of raw ingredients (right now, do not be concerned about how you might derive expressions like these for b and s). Grab your pencil and paper and play along. \n 7 15 (4 \n f - 3300) + 6 15 ( \n - 5 f + 4800) + 2 15 \n f = 0f + 5700 15 \n = 380 5 15 (4 \n f - 3300) + 5 15 ( \n - 5 f + 4800) + 5 15 \n f = 0f + 7500 15 \n = 500 3 15 (4 \n f - 3300) + 4 15 ( \n - 5 f + 4800) + 8 15 \n f = 0f + 9300 15 \n = 620 \nConvince yourself that these expressions for b and s allow us to vary f and obtain an infinite number of possibilities for solutions to the three equations that describe our storage capacities. As a practical matter, there really are not an infinite number of solutions, since we are unlikely to want to end the day with a fractional number of bags of fancy mix, so our allowable values of f should probably be integers. More importantly, we need to remember that we cannot make negative amounts of each mix! Where does this lead us? Positive quantities of the bulk mix requires that \nb >= 0 = 4 f - 3300 >= 0 = f >= 825 Similarly for the standard mix, s >= 0 = - 5 f + 4800 >= 0 = f <= 960 So, as production manager, you really have to choose a value of f from the finite set \n { 825 , 826 ,... , 960 } \nleaving you with 136 choices, each of which will exhaust the day's supply of raw ingredients. Pause now and think about which you would choose. \nSSW I L A B e e z e r : A F i r s t C o u r s e i n L i n e a r A l g e b r a 5 \nRecalling your weekly meeting with the CEO suggests that you might want to choose a production schedule that yields the biggest possible profit for the company. So you compute an expression for the profit based on your as yet undetermined decision for the value of f , \n(4f - 3300)(4. 99 - 3 .70) + (- 5 f + 4800)(5. 50 - 3 .85) + (f )(6. 50 - 4 .45) = - 1. 04 f + 3663 Since f has a negative coefficient it would appear that mixing fancy mix is detrimental to your profit and should be avoided. So you will make the decision to set daily fancy mix production at f = 825. This has the effect of setting b = 4(825) - 3300 = 0 and we stop producing bulk mix entirely. So the remainder of your daily production is standard mix at the level of s = -5(825) + 4800 = 675 kilograms and the resulting daily profit is (- 1 .04)(825) + 3663 = 2805. It is a pleasant surprise that daily profit has risen to $2,805, but this is not the most important part of the story. What is important here is that there are a large number of ways to produce trail mix that use all of the day's worth of raw ingredients and you were able to easily choose the one that netted the largest profit. Notice too how all of the above computations look \"linear.\" In the food industry, things do not stay the same for long, and now the sales department says that increased competition has led to the decision to stay competitive and charge just $5.25 for a kilogram of the standard mix, rather than the previous $5.50 per kilogram. This decision has no effect on the possibilities for the production schedule, but will affect the decision based </passage>"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<tool_call>\\n{\"arguments\": {\"queries\": ['What do you think will happen if the storage capacities or raw ingredient supply were to change?', \"Based on the given information, what do you predict will be the main focus of the CEO's meeting with the production manager?\", 'How do you think the decision to charge $5.25 per kilogram for the standard mix will impact the daily profit?'], \"name\": \"ExpertQAExtractor\"}}\\n</tool_call>"}]}

And indeed, this chapter will contain a repeat of some elementary school concepts! But this is so we can re-examine the foundations and generalize them somewhat. The mechanical processes you've always used with numbers -- adding, subtracting, comparing, checking whether something divides evenly, working with place value -- are all correct, but they're all hard-coded for _decimal_ numbers. The word \"decimal,\" in this chapter, won't mean \"a number with a decimal point, like 5.62\" but rather a number _expressed in base 10_. And what does \"expressed in base 10\" mean? It means that the digits, from right to left, represent a \"one's place,\" a \"ten's place,\" a \"hundred's place,\" and so on. This is what we all learned in grade school, and perhaps you thought that's just how numbers \"were.\" But it turns out that 1, 10, 100, 1000,... , is just one choice of place values, and that we could equally as well choose many other things, like 1, 2, 4, 8,... , or 1, 16, 256, 4096,... , or even 1, 23, 529, 12167,... , as long as those values are of a certain type (successive powers of the base). \nIt's the concept of bases, and specifically bases other than 10, that will cause us to rethink some things. It'll feel unnatural at first, but soon you'll discover that there are aspects of how you work with numbers that are unnecessarily specific, and that it's freeing \n 165 \n166 CHAPTER 7. NUMBERS \nto treat them in a more general way. \n**7.1 What is a \"number?\"** \nBefore we do anything with bases, let's talk about the concept of **number** , generally. The question \"what is a number?\" sounds like the dumbest question I could possibly ask you. Yet I predict that unless you've studied this material before, you have a whole bunch of tangled thoughts in your head regarding what \"numbers\" are, and those tangled thoughts are of two kinds. Some of them are about numbers _per se_. Others are about _base-10 numbers_. If you're like most people, you think of these two sets of concepts as equally \"primary,\" to the point where a number seems to _be_ a base-10 number. It's hard to conceive of it in any other way. It's this prejudice that I want to expose and root out at the beginning. \nMost people, if I asked them to name a number, would come up with something like \"seventeen.\" This much is correct. But if I asked them what their mental image was of the number \"seventeen,\" they would immediately form the following unalterable picture: \n###### 17 \nTo them, the number \"seventeen\" is intrinsically a two-characterlong entity: the digit 1 followed by the digit 7. That _is_ the number. If I were to tell them that there are other, equally valid ways of representing the number seventeen -- using more, less, or the same number of digits -- they'd be very confused. Yet this is in fact the case. And the only reason that the particular two-digit image \"17\" is so baked into our brains is that we were hard-wired from an early age to think in decimal numbers. We cranked through our times tables and did all our carrying and borrowing in base 10, and in the process we built up an incredible amount of inertia that is hard to overcome. A big part of your job this chapter will be to \"unlearn\" this dependence on decimal numbers, so that you can work with numbers in other bases, particularly those used in the design of computers. \n7.1. WHAT IS A \"NUMBER?\" 167 \nWhen you think of a number, I want you to try to erase the sequence of digits from your mind. Think of a number as what is is: a **quantity**. Here's what the number seventeen _really_ looks like: \nIt's just an _amount_. There are more circles in that picture than in some pictures, and less than in others. But in no way is it \"two digits,\" nor do the particular digits \"1\" and \"7\" come into play any more or less than any other digits. \nLet's keep thinking about this. Consider this number, which I'll label \"A\": \n (A) \nNow let's add another circle to it, creating a different number I'll call \"B\": \n (B) \nAnd finally, we'll do it one more time to get \"C\": \n (C) \n(Look carefully at those images and convince yourself that I added one circle each time.) \nWhen going from A to B, I added one circle. When going from B to C, I also added one circle. Now I ask you: was going from B to C any more \"significant\" than going from A to B? Did anything qualitatively different happen? \nThe answer is obviously no. Adding a circle is adding a circle; there's nothing more to it than that. But if you had been writing \n168 CHAPTER 7. NUMBERS \nthese numbers out as base-10 representations, like you're used to doing, you might have thought differently. You'd have gone from: \n(A) (^8) to (B) (^9) to (C) (^10) When going from B to C, your \"odometer\" wrapped around. You had to go from a one-digit number to a two-digit number, simply because you ran out of room in one digit. This can lead to the _illusion_ that something fundamentally different happens when you go from B to C. _This is completely an illusion._ Nothing different happens to the _number_ just because the way we write it down changes. Human beings have a curious habit of thinking that odometer changes are significant. When the temperature breaks 100, it suddenly feels \"more hotter\" than it did when it merely rose from 98 to \n99. When the Dow Jones Industrial Average first reached 10,000, and when Pete Rose eclipsed 4,000 career hits, and when the year 2000 dawned, we tended to think that something truly important had taken place. But as we'll see, the point at which these mile- stones occur is utterly and even laughably aribitrary: it simply has to do with what number we've chosen as our _base_. And we quite honestly could have chosen any number at all. \n**7.2 Bases** \nAs I mentioned, a **base** is simply a number that's an anchor for our place value system. It represents _how many distinct symbols we will use to represent numbers._ This implicitly sets the value of the \n7.2. BASES 169 \nlargest quantity we can hold in one digit, before we'd need to \"roll over\" to two digits. \nIn base 10 (decimal), we use ten symbols: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. Consequently, the number nine is the highest value we can hold in a single digit. Once we add another element to a set of nine, we have no choice but to add another digit to express it. This makes a \"ten's place\" because it will represent the number of sets-of-10 (which we couldn't hold in the 1's place) that the value contains. \nNow why is the next place over called the \"hundred's place\" instead of, say, the \"twenty's place\"? Simply because twenty -- as well as every other number less than a hundred -- comfortably fits in two digits. We can have up to 9 in the one's place, and also _up to 9 in the ten's place_ , giving us a total of ninety-nine before we ever have to cave in to using three digits. The number one hundred is exactly the point at which we _must_ roll over to three digits; therefore, the sequence of digits 1-0-0 represents one hundred. \nIf the chosen base isn't obvious from context (as it often won't be in this chapter) then when we write out a sequence of digits we'll append the base as a subscript to the end of the number. So the number \"four hundred and thirty-seven\" will be written as 43710. \nThe way we interpret a decimal number, then, is by counting the right-most digits as a number of _individuals_ , the digit to its left as the number of _groups of ten_ individuals, the digit to _its_ left as the number of groups of hundred individuals, and so on. 547210 is just a way of writing 5 x 1000 + 4 x 100 + 7 x 10 + 2 x 1. \nIf we use exponential notation (remember that anything to the 0 th power is 1), this is equivalent to: \n 547210 = 5 x 103 + 4 x 102 + 7 x 101 + 2 x 100. \nBy the way, we will often use the term **least significant digit** to refer to the right-most digit (2, in the above example), and **most significant digit** to refer to the left-most (5). \"Significant\" simply refers to how much that digit is \"worth\" in the overall magnitude \n170 CHAPTER 7. NUMBERS \nof the number. Obviously 239 is less than 932, so we say that the hundreds place is more significant than the other digits. \nAll of this probably seems pretty obvious to you. All right then. Let's use a base other than ten and see how you do. Let's write out a number _in base 7_. We have seven symbols at our disposal: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Wait, you ask -- why not 7? Because there is no digit for seven in a base 7 system, just like there is no digit for ten in a base 10 system. Ten is the point where we need _two_ digits in a decimal system, and analogously, seven is the point where we'll need two digits in our base 7 system. How will we write the value seven? Just like this: **10**. Now stare at those two digits and practice saying \"seven\" as you look at them. All your life you've been trained to say the number \"ten\" when you see the digits 1 and 0 printed like that. But those two digits only represent the number ten _if you're using a base 10 system._ If you're using a base 34 system, \"10\" is how you write \"thirty-four.\" \nVery well, we have our seven symbols. Now how do we interpret a number like 61537? It's this: \n 61537 = 6 x 73 + 1 x 72 + 5 x 71 + 3 x 70. \nThat doesn't look so strange: it's very parallel to the decimal string we expanded, above. It looks weirder when we actually multiply out the place values: \n 61537 = 6 x 343 + 1 x 49 + 5 x 7 + 3 x 1. \nSo in base 7, we have a \"one's place,\" a \"seven's place,\" a \"fortynine's place,\" and a \"three hundred forty-three's place.\" This seems unbelievably bizarre -- how could a number system possibly hold together with such place values? -- but I'll bet it </passage>"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<tool_call>\\n{\"arguments\": {\"queries\": ['Can you critique the use of decimal numbers as the default in our understanding of numbers?', 'How would you assess the effectiveness of teaching numbers in different bases to students?', 'In your opinion, what are the advantages and disadvantages of using different bases in number systems?'], \"name\": \"ExpertQAExtractor\"}}\\n</tool_call>"}]}

Academic books generally fall into three categories: (1) textbooks written with students in mind, (2) monographs (books) that give an extended report on a large research project, and (3) edited volumes in which each chapter is authored by different people. Scholarly articles appear in academic journals, which are published multiple times a year in order to share the latest research findings with scholars in the field. They're usually sponsored by some academic society. To get published, these articles and books had to earn favorable anonymous evaluations by qualified scholars. Who are the experts writing, reviewing, and editing these scholarly publications? Your professors. Learning how to read and use these sources is a fundamental part of being a college student. Some events and trends are too recent to appear in Tier 1 sources. Also, Tier 1 sources tend to be highly specific, and sometimes you need a more general perspective on a topic. Thus, Tier 2 sources can provide quality information that is more accessible to nonacademics. There are three main categories: \n**1.** These are official reports from government agencies or major international     institutions like the World Bank or the United Nations; these institutions     generally have research departments staffed with qualified experts who seek     to provide rigorous, even-handed information to decision-makers. \n**2.** Feature articles from major newspapers and magazines like the _New York_     _Times_ , _Wall Street Journal_ , _London Times_ , or the _Economist_ are based on original \n#### TIER 1 \n##### PEER-REVIEWED ACADEMIC PUBLICATIONS \n#### TIER 2 \n##### REPORTS, ARTICLES, AND BOOKS FROM CREDIBLE NONACADEMIC SOURCES \n 155 COLLECTED WORKS \n reporting by experienced journalists (not press releases) and are typically fifteen hundred-plus words in length. \n**3.** There are some great books from nonacademic presses that cite their sources;     they're often written by journalists. All three of these sources are generally well-researched descriptions of an event or state of the world, undertaken by credentialed experts who generally seek to be evenhanded. It is still up to you to judge their credibility. Your instructors and campus librarians can advise you on which sources in this category have the most credibility. A step below the well-developed reports and feature articles that make up Tier 2 are the short tidbits that one finds in newspapers and magazines or credible websites. How short is a short news article? Usually, they're just a couple paragraphs or less, and they're often reporting on just one thing: an event, an interesting research finding, or a policy change. They don't take extensive research and analysis to write, and many just summarize a press release written and distributed by an organization or business. They may describe things like corporate mergers, newly discovered diet-health links, or important school-funding legislation. You may want to cite Tier 3 sources in your paper if they provide an important factoid or two that isn't provided by a higher-tier piece, but if the Tier 3 article describes a particular study or academic expert, your best bet is to find the journal article or book it is reporting on and use that Tier 1 source instead. The original sources are usually linked; if not, you can find the original journal article by putting the scholar's name and some keywords into Google Scholar or your library website. What counts as a credible website in this tier? You may need some guidance from instructors or librarians, but you can learn a lot by examining the person or organization providing the information (look for an \"About\" link). For example, if the organization is clearly agenda driven or not up-front about its aims and/or funding sources, then it definitely isn't something you want to cite as a neutral authority. Also look for signs of expertise. A tidbit about a medical research finding written by someone with a science background carries more weight than the same topic written by a policy analyst. These sources are sometimes uncertain, which is all the more reason to follow the trail to a Tier 1 or Tier 2 source whenever possible. This tier is essentially everything else, including Wikipedia. These types of sources--especially Wikipedia--can be hugely helpful in identifying interesting topics, positions within a debate, keywords to search, and, sometimes, higher-tier sources on the topic. They often play a critically important role in the early part of the research process, but they generally aren't (and \n#### TIER 3 \n##### SHORT PIECES FROM PERIODICALS OR CREDIBLE WEBSITES \n#### TIER 4 \n##### AGENDA DRIVEN OR PIECES FROM UNKNOWN SOURCES \n A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 156 \n shouldn't be) cited in the final paper. Throwing some keywords into Google and seeing what you get is a fine way to get started, but don't stop there. Start a list of the people, organizations, sources, and keywords that seem most relevant to your topic. For example, suppose you've been assigned a research paper about the impact of linen production and trade on the ancient world. A quick Google search reveals that (1) linen comes from the flax plant, (2) the scientific name for flax is Linum usitatissimum , (3) Egypt dominated linen production at the height of its empire, and (4) Alex J. Warden published a book about ancient linen trade in 1867. Similarly, you found some useful search terms to try instead of \"ancient world\" (antiquity, Egyptian empire, ancient Egypt, ancient Mediterranean) and some generalizations for linen (fabric, textiles, or weaving). Now you've got a lot to work with as you tap into the library catalog and academic article databases. Most of the Tier 1 sources available are academic articles, also called scholarly articles, scholarly papers, journal articles, academic papers, or peer-reviewed articles. They all mean the same thing: a paper published in an academic periodical after being scrutinized anonymously and judged to be sound by other experts in the subfield. Their origin explains both their basic structure and the high esteem they have in the eyes of your professors. Many journals are sponsored by academic associations. Most academics belong to a big, general one (such as the Modern Language Association, the American Psychological Association, the National Association for Sport and Physical Education, or the American Physical Society) and one or more smaller ones organized around particular areas of interest and expertise (such as the Association for the Study of Food and Society, the International Association for Statistical Computing, or the Slavic and East European Folklore Association). There are also generalist organizations organized by region of the country or state, such as the Eastern Sociological Society or the Southern Management Association. Each of these associations exists to promote the exchange of research findings and collaboration in their disciplines. Toward this end, they organize conferences, sponsor working groups, and publish one or more academic journals. These journals are meant to both publicize and archive the most interesting and important findings in the field. Academic papers are essentially reports that scholars write to their peers--present and future--about what they've done in their research, what they've found, and why they think it's important. Thus, in a lot of fields, they often have a structure reminiscent of the lab reports you've written for science classes: \n**1.** _Abstract:_ A one-paragraph summary of the article: its purpose, methods,     findings, and significance. \n**2.** _Introduction:_ An overview of the key question or problem that the paper     addresses, why it is important, and the key conclusion(s) (i.e., thesis or theses)     of the paper. \n**3.** _Literature review:_ A synthesis of all the relevant prior research (the so-called     academic literature on the subject) that explains why the paper makes an     original and important contribution to the body of knowledge. \n#### ORIGINS AND ANATOMY OF A JOURNAL ARTICLE \n 157 COLLECTED WORKS \n**4.** _Data and methods:_ An explanation of what data or information the author(s)     used and what they did with it. \n**5.** _Results:_ A full explanation of the key findings of the study. \n**6.** _Conclusion/discussion:_ Puts the key findings or insights from the paper into     their broader context; explains why they matter. Not all papers are so \"science.\" For example, a historical or literary analysis doesn't necessarily have a \"data and methods\" section, but it does explain and justify the research question, describe how the authors' own points relate to those made in other relevant articles and books, develop the key insights yielded by the analysis, and conclude by explaining their significance. Some academic papers are review articles in which the \"data\" are published papers and the \"findings\" are key insights, enduring lines of debate, and/or remaining unanswered questions. Scholarly journals use a peer-review process to decide which articles merit publication. First, hopeful authors send their article manuscript to the journal editor, a role filled by a prominent scholar in the field. The editor reads over the manuscript and decides whether it seems worthy of peer review. If it's outside the interests of the journal or is clearly inadequate, the editor will reject it outright. If it looks appropriate and sufficiently high quality, the editor will recruit a few other experts in the field to act as anonymous peer reviewers. The editor will send the manuscript (scrubbed of identifying information) to the reviewers who will read it closely and provide a thorough critique.  Is the research question driving the paper timely and important?  Does the paper sufficiently and accurately review all of the relevant prior research?  Are the information sources believable and the research methods rigorous?  Are the stated results fully justified by the findings?  Is the significance of the research clear?  Is it well written?  Overall, does the paper add new, trustworthy, and important knowledge to the field? Reviewers send their comments to the editor, who then decides whether to (1) reject the manuscript, (2) ask the author(s) to revise and resubmit the manuscript, or (3) accept it for publication. Editors send the reviewers' comments (again, with no identifying information) to authors along with their decisions. A manuscript that has been revised and resubmitted usually goes out for peer review again; editors often try to get reviews from one or two first-round reviewers as well as a new reviewer. The whole process, from start to finish, can easily take a year, and it is often another year before the paper appears in print. Understanding the academic publication process and the structure of scholarly articles tells you a lot about how to find, read, and use these sources: A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 158 \n Instead of paging through mountains of dubious web content, go right to the relevant scholarly article databases in order to quickly find the highest-quality sources. Abstracts tell you immediately whether the article you're holding is relevant or useful to the paper you're assigned to write. You shouldn't ever have the experience of reading the whole paper just to discover it's not useful. Knowing the anatomy of a scholarly article tells you what you should be reading for in each section. For example, you don't necessarily need to understand every nuance of the literature review. You can just focus on why the authors claim that their own study is distinct from the ones that came before. Not every social scientist understands the intricacies of log-linear modeling of quantitative survey data; however, the reviewers definitely do, and they found the analysis to be well constructed. Thus, you can accept the findings as legitimate and just focus on the passages that explain the findings and their significance in plainer language. If you have a really good article that's a few years old, you can use article databases to find newer articles that cited it in their own literature reviews. That immediately tells you which ones are on the same topic and offer newer findings. On the other hand, if your first source is recent, the literature review section will describe the other papers in the same line of research. You can look them up directly. Students sometimes grumble when they're ordered to use scholarly articles in their research. It seems a lot easier to just Google some terms and find stuff that way. However, academic articles are the most efficient resource out there. They are vetted by experts and structured specifically to help readers zero in on the most important passages. Your campus library pays big money to subscribe to databases for Tier 1 articles. Some are general purpose databases that include the most prominent journals across disciplines, and some are specific to a particular discipline. Often they have the full text of the articles right there for you to save or print. We won't go over particular databases here because every campus has different offerings.

As you discover useful sources, try to expand your usual research process by experimenting with the techniques and resources included in this chapter. The first and most important determining factor of your research is where you choose to begin. Although there are a great number of credible and useful texts available across different search platforms, I generally encourage my students to begin with two resources: \n**1.** Their college or university's library and its website \n**2.** Google Scholar These resources are not bulletproof, and you can't always find what you need through them. However, their general search functionality and the databases from which they draw tend to be more reliable, specific, and professional. It is quite likely that your argument will be better received if it relies on the kind of sources you discover with these tools. \n##### Your Library \n Although the following information primarily focuses on making good use of your library's online tools, one of the most valuable and underutilized resources at your disposal is the librarians themselves. Do you know if your school has research librarians on staff? Research librarians (or reference librarians) are not only well versed in the research process but also passionate about supporting students in their inquiry. It's also possible that your library offers research support that you can access remotely: many colleges and universities provide librarian support via instant message/chat or email. Some libraries even make video tutorials and do-it-yourself research tips and tricks. The first step in learning how your library will support you is to investigate their website. Although I can't provide specific instruction for the use of your library website--they are all slightly different--I encourage you to spend ten minutes familiarizing yourself with the site, considering the following questions especially:  Does the site have an FAQ section, student support, a librarian chat service, 165 COLLECTED WORKS \nor a DIY link in case you have questions?  Does the site have an integrated search bar (i.e., a search engine that allows you to search some or all databases and the library catalog simultaneously)?  How do you access the \"advanced search\" function of the library's search bar?  Does your account have a folder or reading list to save sources you find?  Is your library a member of a resource-sharing network, like ILLiad or Summit? How do you request a source through this network?  Does your library subscribe to multimedia or digital resource services, like video streaming or e-book libraries?  Does the site offer any citation management support software, like Mendeley or Zotero? Most schools pay subscriptions to databases filled with academic works in addition to owning a body of physical texts (books, DVDs, magazines, etc.). Some schools are members of exchange services for physical texts as well (such as Summit or ILLiad), in which case a network of libraries can provide resources to students at your school. It is worth noting that most library websites use an older form of search technology. You have likely realized that day-to-day search engines like Google will predict what you're searching for, correct your spelling, and automatically return results that your search terms might not have exactly aligned with. For example, I could Google _How many baksetbal players on Jazzz roster_ , and I would still likely get the results I needed. Most library search engines don't do this, so you need to be very deliberate with your search terms. Here are some tips:  Consider synonyms and jargon that might be more likely to yield results. As you research, you will become more fluent in the language of your subject. Keep track of vocabulary that other scholars use, and revise your search terms based on this context-specific language.  Use the Boolean operators? and * for expanded results:  _wom?n_ yields results for _woman, women, womyn,_ and so on  _medic*_ yields results for _medic, medicine, medication, medicinal, medical,_ and so on  Use the advanced search feature to combine search terms, exclude certain results, limit the search terms' applicability, and so on.  Use the filters (usually on the left or right side of the page) to sort for the kinds of sources you want. For example, if you are looking for academic sources, you can filter for \"peer-reviewed articles.\" A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 166 \n##### Other Resources \n As we will continue to discuss, the most useful sources for your research project are not always proper academic, peer-reviewed articles. For instance, if I were writing a paper on the experience of working for United Airlines, a compelling blog post by a flight attendant that speaks to the actual working conditions they experienced might be more appropriate than a data-driven scholarly investigation of the United Airlines consumer trends. You might find that a TED Talk, a published interview, an advertisement, or some other nonacademic source would be useful for your writing. Therefore, it's important that you evaluate all the texts you encounter, being especially careful with texts that some people might see as unreliable. (See \"The CRAAP Test: Evaluating Traditional Sources\" and \"Four Moves and a Habit: Evaluating Web Sources\" for more on evaluating sources.) \n##### Additional Techniques For Discovering Sources \n All it takes is one or two really good sources to get you started. You should keep your perspective wide to catch as much as you can--but if you've found a handful of good sources, the following are tools that can help you find even more:  The author of that perfect article probably got some of their information from somewhere else, just like you. Citation mining is the process of using a text's citations, bibliography, or notes to track down other similar or related sources. Plug the author's citations into your school's library search engine or Google Scholar to see if you have access.  Web of Science is like reverse citation mining: instead of using a text's bibliography to find more sources, you find other sources that cite your text in their bibliographies. Web of Science is a digital archive that shows you connections between different authors and their writing--and not only for science! If you find a good source that is documented in this database, you can see other texts that cite that source.  Bootstrapping is a technique that works best on search engines with detail features, like your library search engine. Search engines tag each text with certain subject keywords. By clicking on those keywords, you can link to other texts tagged with the same keywords, typically according to Library of Congress standards. The first and most important piece of advice I can offer you as you begin to dig into these sources: stay organized. By taking notes and keeping a record of where each idea is coming from, you save yourself a lot of time--and avoid the risk of unintentional plagiarism. The original chapter, Interacting with Sources by Shane Abrams, is from EmpoWord: A Student-Centered Anthology and Handbook for College Writers 167 COLLECTED WORKS \n**1.** What is your typical research process?

As you sift through sources, you should consider credibility and use value to determine whether a source is right for you. Credibility refers to the reliability and accuracy of the author, their writing, and the publisher. Use value is a broad term that includes whether you should use a text in your research paper as well as how you will use that text. The CRAAP Test will help you explore both credibility and use value, and it's especially useful when evaluating sources that you are carefully considering for use in a paper. In chapter 23, Mike Caulfield offers a faster set of strategies for determining the validity of information you find in your day-to-day life online. \n#### THE CRAAP TEST \n 171 A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT \n Table 22.1 Explaining the initialism CRAAP \n##### Feature Explanation \n##### Currency \n##### (C) \n How recently was the text created?

(255) A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 8 \n Don't be scared whenever you are given an assignment. Professors know what it was like to be in college and write all kinds of papers. They aren't trying to make your lives difficult, but it is their job to make us think and ponder about many things. Take your time and enjoy the paper. Make sure you answer the question being asked rather than rant on about something that is irrelevant to the prompt. TIMOTHEE PIZARRO writing student discussion question, blog post, essay exam, project proposal, or what have you--is ultimately about your learning. To succeed with writing assignments (and benefit from them), you first have to understand their learning-related purposes. As you write for the hypothetical audience of peer junior scholars, you're demonstrating to your professor how far you've gotten in analyzing your topic. Instructors don't assign writing lightly. Grading student writing is generally the hardest, most intensive work instructors do. You would do well to approach every assignment by putting yourself in the shoes of your instructor and asking yourself, \"Why did they give me this assignment? How does it fit into the learning goals of the course? Why is this question/topic/problem so important to my instructor that they are willing to spend evenings and weekends reading and commenting on several dozen papers on it?\" Most instructors do a lot to make their pedagogical goals and expectations transparent to students: they explain the course learning goals associated with assignments, provide grading rubrics in advance, and describe several strategies for succeeding. Other instructors...not so much. Some students perceive more open-ended assignments as evidence of a lazy, uncaring, or even incompetent instructor. Not so fast! Instructors certainly vary in the quantity and specificity of the guidelines and suggestions they distribute with each writing assignment. It is understandably frustrating when you feel you don't know how to direct your efforts to succeed with an assignment. However, except for rare egregious situations, you would do well to assume the best of your instructor and to appreciate the diversity of learning opportunities you have access to in college. Like one first-year student told Keith Hjortshoj, \"I think that every course, every assignment, is a different little puzzle I have to solve. What do I need to do here? When do I need to do it, and how long will it take? What does this teacher expect of me?\" (4). The transparency that you get from some professors--along with guides like this one--will be a big help to you in situations where you have to be scrappier and more proactive, piecing together the clues you get from your professors, the readings, and other course documents. \n##### The Prompt: What Does \"Analyze\" Mean Anyway? \n Often, the handout or other written text explaining the assignment--what instructors call the assignment prompt--will explain the purpose of the assignment, the required parameters (length, number and type of sources, referencing style, etc.), and the criteria for evaluation. Sometimes, though--especially when you are new to a field--you will encounter the baffling situation in which you comprehend every single sentence in the prompt but still have absolutely no idea how to approach the assignment. No one is doing anything wrong in a situation like that. It just means that further discussion of the assignment is in order. Here are some tips: 9 COLLECTED WORKS \n Look for verbs like \"compare,\" \"explain,\" \"justify,\" \"reflect,\" or the all-purpose \"analyze.\" You're not just producing a paper as an artifact; you're conveying, in written communication, some intellectual work you have done. So the question is, What kind of thinking are you supposed to do to deepen your learning? Many professors think in terms of assignment sequences. For example, a social science professor may ask you to write about a controversial issue three times: first, arguing for one side of the debate; second, arguing for another; and finally, arguing from a more comprehensive and nuanced perspective, incorporating text produced in the first two assignments. A sequence like that is designed to help you think through a complex issue. Another common one is a scaffolded research paper sequence: you first propose a topic, then prepare an annotated bibliography, then make the first draft, then make the final draft, and finally, perhaps, create a reflective paper. The preparatory assignments help ensure that you're on the right track, beginning the research process long before the final due date and taking the time to consider recasting your thesis, finding additional sources, or reorganizing your discussion. (Most instructors are perpetually frustrated with the \"one-and-done\" attitude that most students bring to their work, and some sequences are specifically designed to force you to really rethink your conclusions.) If the assignment isn't part of a sequence, think about where it falls in the semester and how it relates to readings and other assignments. Are there headings on the syllabus that indicate larger units of material? For example, if you see that a paper comes at the end of a three-week unit on the role of the internet in organizational behavior, then your professor likely wants you to synthesize that material in your own way. You should also check your notes and online course resources for any other guidelines about the workflow. Maybe you got a rubric a couple of weeks ago and forgot about it. Maybe your instructor posted a link about \"how to make an annotated bibliography\" but then forgot to mention it in class. When I hand out an assignment, I often ask students to do a five-minute or tenminute freewrite. A freewrite is when you just write, without stopping, for a set period of time. That doesn't sound very \"free\"; it actually sounds kind of coerced. The \"free\" part is what you write--it can be whatever comes to mind. Professional writers use freewriting to get started on a challenging (or distasteful) writing task or to overcome writer's block or a powerful urge to procrastinate. The idea is that if you just make yourself write, you can't help but produce some kind of useful nugget. Thus, even if the first eight sentences of your freewrite are all variations on \"I don't understand this\" or \"I'd really rather be doing something else,\" eventually you'll write something like \"I guess the main point of this is...\" and--booyah!--you're off and running. As an instructor, I've found that asking students to do a brief freewrite right after I hand out an assignment generates useful clarification questions. If your \n##### Focus on the verbs \n##### Put the assignment in context \n##### Try a freewrite \n A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 10 \n instructor doesn't make time for that in class, a quick freewrite on your own will quickly reveal whether you need clarification about the assignment and, often, what questions to ask. Even the most skillfully crafted assignments may need some verbal clarification, especially because students' familiarity with the field can vary enormously. Asking for clarification is a good thing. Be aware, though, that instructors get frustrated when they perceive that students want to skip doing their own thinking and instead receive an exact recipe for an A paper. Go ahead and ask for clarification, but try to convey that you want to learn and you're ready to work. In general, avoid starting a question with \"Do we have to...\" because I can guarantee that your instructor is thinking, \"You don't have to do anything. You're an adult. You chose college. You chose this class. You're free to exercise your right to fail.\" Similarly, avoid asking the professor about what he or she \"wants.\" You're not performing some service for the instructor when you write a paper. What they \"want\" is for you to really think about the material. Table 2.1 Suggested alternatives to frequently asked (and potentially annoying) questions \n##### Potentially annoying \n##### questions \n##### Preferable alternatives \n##### \"I don't get it. Can you \n##### explain this more?\" or \n##### \"What do you want us \n##### to do?\" \n \"I see that we are comparing and contrasting these two cases. What should be our focus? Their causes? Their impacts? Their implications? All of those things?\" or \"I'm unfamiliar with how art historians analyze a painting. Could you say more about what questions I should have in mind to do this kind of analysis?\" \n##### \"How many sources do \n##### we have to cite?\" \n \"Is there a typical range for the number of sources a well-written paper would cite for this assignment?\" or \"Could you say more about what the sources are for? Is it more that we're analyzing these texts in this paper, or are we using these texts to analyze some other case?\" \n##### \"What do I have to do \n##### to get an A on this \n##### paper?\" \n \"Could I meet with you to get feedback on my (preprepared) plans/outline/thesis/draft?\" or \"I'm not sure how to approach this assignment. Are there any good examples or resources you could point me to?\" If an instructor provides a grading rubric with an assignment prompt, you can be sure that he or she will use it to grade your paper. He or she may not go over it in class, but it's the clearest possible statement of what the professor is looking for in the paper. If it's wordy, it may seem like those online \"terms and conditions\" that we routinely accept without reading. But you really should read it over carefully before you begin and again as your work progresses. A lot of rubrics do have some useful specifics. Mine, for example, often contain phrases like \"makes at least six error-free connections to concepts or ideas from the course\" or \"gives thorough consideration to at least one plausible counterargument.\" Even less specific criteria (such as \"incorporates course concepts\" and \"considers counterarguments\") will tell you how you should be spending your writing time. \n##### Ask for clarification the right way. \n#### RUBRICS AS ROAD MAPS \n 11 COLLECTED WORKS \n Even the best rubrics aren't completely transparent. They simply can't be. Take, for example, the Association of American Colleges and Universities (AAC&U) rubric. It has been drafted and repeatedly revised by a multidisciplinary expert panel and tested multiple times on sample student work to ensure reliability. But it still seems kind of vague. What is the real difference between \"demonstrating a thorough understanding of context, audience, and purpose\" and \"demonstrating adequate consideration\" of the same? It depends on the specific context. So how can you know whether you've done that? A big part of what you're learning, through feedback from your professors, is to judge the quality of your writing for yourself. Your future bosses are counting on that. At this point, it is better to think of rubrics as road maps displaying your destination rather than GPS systems directing every move you make. Behind any rubric is the essential goal of higher education: helping you take charge of your own learning, which means writing like an independently motivated scholar. Are you tasked with proposing a research paper topic? Don't just tell the professor what you want to do; convince him or her of the salience of your topic as if you were a scholar seeking grant money. Is it a reflection paper? Then outline both the insights you've gained and the intriguing questions that remain, as a scholar would. Are you writing a thesis-driven analytical paper? Then apply the concepts you've learned to a new problem or situation. Write as if your scholarly peers around the country are eagerly awaiting your unique insights. Descriptors like \"thoroughness\" or \"mastery\" or \"detailed attention\" convey the vision of student writers making the time and rigorous mental effort to offer something new to the ongoing, multistranded academic conversation. What your professor wants, in short, is critical thinking. Critical thinking is one of those terms that has been used so often and in so many different ways that it often seems meaningless. It also makes one wonder, is there such a thing as uncritical thinking? If you aren't thinking critically, then are you even thinking? Despite the prevalent ambiguities, critical thinking actually does mean something. The Association of American Colleges and Universities (AAC&U) usefully defines it as \"a habit of mind characterized by the comprehensive exploration of issues, ideas, artifacts, and events before accepting or formulating an opinion or conclusion\" (\"Value Rubrics\"). That definition aligns with the best description of critical thinking I ever heard; it came from my junior high art teacher, Joe Bolger. He once asked us, \"What color is the ceiling?\" In that withering tween tone, we reluctantly replied, \"White.\" He then asked, \"What color is it really?\" We deigned to aim our preadolescent eyes upward and eventually began to offer more accurate answers: \"Ivory?\" \"Yellowish tan.\" \"It's gray in that corner.\" After finally getting a few thoughtful responses, Mr. Bolger said something like, \"Making good art is about drawing what you see, not what you think you're supposed to see.\" The AAC&U definition above essentially amounts to the same thing: taking a good look and deciding what you really think rather than relying on the first idea or assumption that comes to mind. The critical thinking rubric produced by the AAC&U describes the relevant activities of critical thinking in more detail. To think critically, you need to establish the question or problem, evaluate your sources, interrogate the assumptions informing the ideas you encounter, and develop a nuanced position that accounts for multiple perspectives (\"Value Rubrics\"). \n#### WHAT'S CRITICAL ABOUT CRITICAL THINKING? \n A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 12 \nWhile you are probably used to providing some evidence for your claims, you can see that college-level expectations go quite a bit further. When professors assign an analytical paper, they don't just want you to formulate a plausible-sounding argument. They want you to dig into the evidence, think hard about unspoken assumptions and the influence of context, and then explain what you really think and why. Interestingly, the AAC&U defines critical thinking as a \"habit of mind\" rather than a discrete achievement. And there are at least two reasons to see critical thinking as a craft or art to pursue rather than a task to check off.

LOGIC \nSo these two cases both result in true. But perhaps surprisingly, we also get true for oatmeal: \n Human(oatmeal) = Adult(oatmeal)  Child(oatmeal) false = false  false false = false true X \nWhoa, how did _true_ pop out of that? Simply because the premise was false, and so all bets were off. We effectively said \" _if_ a bowl of oatmeal is human, _then_ it will either be an adult or a child. But it's not, so never mind.\" Put another way, the bowl of oatmeal did _not_ turn out to be a counterexample, and so we're confident claiming that this expression is true \"for _all_ h\": h. \nThe other kind of quantifier is called the **existential quantifier**. As its name suggests, it asserts the _existence_ of something. We write it \"\" and pronounce it \"there exists.\" For example, \n x HasGovernor(x) \nasserts that there is _at least one_ state that has a governor. This doesn't tell us how _many_ states this is true for, and in fact despite their name, quantifiers really aren't very good at \"quantifying\" things for us, at least numerically. As of 2008, the statement \n x President(x)  African-American(x) \nis true, and always will be, no matter how many more AfricanAmerican U.S. presidents we have. Note that in compound expressions like this, a variable (like x) always stands for a _single_ entity wherever it appears. For hundreds of years there have existed African-Americans, and there have existed Presidents, so the expression above would be ridiculously obvious if it meant only \"there have been Presidents, and there have been African-Americans.\" But the same variable x being used as inputs to _both_ predicates is what seals the deal and makes it represent the much stronger statement \"there is at least one individual who is personally _both_ AfricanAmerican _and_ President of the United States at the same time.\" \n8.2. PREDICATE LOGIC 215 \nIt's common practice to negate quantifiers, both universal and existential. As of 2022, the following statement is still true: \n !p President(p)  Female(p). \nThis conveys that there does _not_ exist a female president. As another example, if one day Missouri overhauls its government structure and replaces it with a mobocracy, perhaps we'll state: \n !x HasGovernor(x). \n**Interchanging quantifiers** \nSome illuminating themes can be seen when we examine the relationship that the two types of quantifiers have to each other. Consider this one first:^3 \n x P (x) = !x !P (x), (8.1) \nwhere P is any predicate (or for that matter, any expression involving many predicates). That's sensible. It states: \"if P is true of all things, then there does _not_ exist anything that it _isn't_ true for.\" Three other equivalences come to light:^4 \n !x P (x) = x !P (x) (8.2) x !P (x) = !x P (x) (8.3) !x !P (x) = x P (x) (8.4) \nIn words, identity 8.2 says \"if it's not true for everything, then it must be false for something.\" Identity 8.3 says \"if it's false for everything, then there's nothing it's true for.\" And identity 8.4 says \"if it's not false for everything, then it must be true for something.\" All of these are eminently logical, I think you'll agree. They also imply that there are nearly always multiple correct ways to state something. In our apocalyptic vision of Missouri, for example, we stated \"!x HasGovernor(x),\" but we could just as well have stated \"x !HasGovernor(x),\" which amounts to the same thing. \n(^3) (8.1) Everybody was driving. = Nobody exists who was not driving. (^4) (8.2) Not everybody was driving. = At least one person was not driving. (8.3) Everybody was not driving. = Nobody was driving. (8.4) Not everybody was not driving. = At least one person was driving. \n216 CHAPTER 8. LOGIC \n**Order matters** \nWhen you're facing an intimidating morass of 's and 's and 's and ='s and God knows what else, it's easy to get lost in the sauce. But you have to be very careful to dissect the expression to find out what it means. Consider this one: \n x  Ry  R x + 1 = y. (8.5) \nThis statement is _true_. It says that for every single real number (call it x), it's true that you can find some other number (call it y) that's one greater than it. If you generate some examples it's easy to see this is true. Suppose we have the real number x = 5. Is there some other number y that's equal to x + 1? Of course, the number 6. What if x = - 32. 4? Is there a number y that satisfies this equation? Of course, y = - 31. 4. Obviously no matter what number x we choose, we can find the desired number y just by adding one. Hence this statement is true _for all_ x, just like it says. \nWhat happens, though, if we innocently switch the order of the quantifiers? Let's try asserting this: \n y  Rx  R x + 1 = y. (8.6) \nIs this also true? Look carefully. It says \"there exists some magic number y that has the following amazing property: no matter what value of x you choose, this y is one greater than x!\" Obviously this is not true. There _is_ no such number y. If I choose y = 13, that works great as long as I choose x = 12, but for any other choice of x, it's dead in the water. \nThe lesson learned here is that the order of quantifiers matters. You have to take each quantifier/variable pair in turn, and think to yourself, \"okay, this statement is asserting that _once I choose_ the first variable, the rest of the expression is true for that choice.\" \n**The value of precision** \nThis fluency with the basic syntax and meaning of predicate logic was our only goal in this chapter. There are all kinds of logical rules that can be applied to predicate logic statements in order to \n8.2. PREDICATE LOGIC 217 \ndeduce further statements, and you'll learn about them when you study artificial intelligence later on. Most of them are formalized versions of common sense. \"If you know A is true, and you know A=B is true, then you can conclude B is true.\" Or \"if you know XY is false, and then you discover that Y is true, you can then conclude that X is false.\" _Etc._ The power to produce new truth from existing truth is the hallmark of AI systems, and why this stuff really matters. \nIf you can imagine a program doing this sort of automated reasoning, it will become clear why the precision of something like predicate logic -- instead of the sloppiness of English -- becomes important. English is a beautiful and poetic language, but its ambiguity is notorious. For example, back in chapter 3 we used the phrase \"some employee belongs to every department\" when describing relations. Now consider that English sentence. What does \"some employee belongs to every department\" actually mean? Does it mean that there is some special employee who happens to hold membership in every department in the company? Or does it mean that no department is empty: all departments have at least _one_ person in them, for crying out loud? The English could mean either. In predicate logic, we're either asserting: \n x Employee(x)  y BelongsTo(x, y) \nor y x Employee(x)  BelongsTo(x, y) \nThese are two very different things. A human being would realize that it's the second one the speaker means, drawing from a whole range of experience and common sense and context clues. But a 'bot has available none of these, and so it demands that the language clearly and unambiguously state exactly what's meant. \nEnglish is rife with these ambiguities, especially involving pronouns. \" **After John hit George he ran away.** \" What happened? Did John run away after striking George, fearing that George would retaliate? Or did George run away after getting hit, fearing additional abuse? It's unclear what \"he\" refers to, so we can't say from the sentence alone. \n218 CHAPTER 8. LOGIC \nHere's a funny one I'll end with. Consider the sentence \" **He made her duck** .\" What is intended here? Did some guy reach out with his hand and forcefully push a woman's head down out of the way of a screaming projectile? Or did he prepare a succulent dish of roasted fowl to celebrate her birthday? Oh, if the computer could only know. If we'd used predicate logic instead of English, it could! \n 8.3. EXERCISES 219 \n**8.3 Exercises** \n Let B be the proposition that Joe Biden was elected president in 2020, C be the proposition that Covid-19 was completely and permanently eradicated from the earth in 2021, and R be the proposition that Roe v. Wade was overturned in 2022. \n1. What's B  C? \n True. \n2. What's B  C? False. \n3. What's B  R? True. \n4. What's B  !R? False. \n5. What's !C  !R? True. \n6. What's !(C  !R)? True. \n7.

What's B  C  R? True. \n15. What's B  C  R? False. \n16. What's B  !C  R? True. \n17. What's B = R? \n True. (Even though there is plainly no causality there.) \n18. What's R = B? True. (Ditto.) \n19. What's B = C? \n False. (The premise is true, so the conclusion must also be true for this sentence to be true.) \n20. What's C = B? \n True. (The premise is false, so all bets are off and the sentence is true.) \n 220 CHAPTER 8. LOGIC \n21. What's C = !R? \n True. (The premise is false, so all bets are off and the sentence is true.) \n22. What's C = B? \n False. (The truth values of the left and right sides are not the same.) \n23. What's C = !B? \n True. (The truth values of the left and right sides are the same.) \n24. I make this assertion: \n \"X  !Y  !(Z = Q).\" And since I'm the professor, you can assume I'm correct about this. From this information alone, can you determine a unique set of values for the four variables? Or is there more than one possibility for them? \n There is actually only one solution. Here's one way to tell. We know that X must be true, since it's being \"and-ed\" in to another expression. We know that Y must be false, since its opposite is similarly being \"anded\" in. Finally, we also know that Z must be true and Q must be false, since the only way an implication (=) can be false is if its premise is true and its conclusion is false. And the implication here must be false if the professor is telling the truth, because its opposite is being \"and-ed\" in to the three other things. So the one and only answer is: X = 1, Y = 0, Z = 1, Q = 0. (You can figure this all out with truth tables too, of course, and for most examples you would. I just wanted to make an exercise that you could figure out in your head without pencil and paper.) \n25. What if I get rid of Q and replace     it with X, thus making my asser-     tion:        \"X  !Y  !(Z = X).\"     Now what is/are the solutions? \n Now it's impossible, and if you study the previous item, you'll see why. The only way that item 24 could be true was if the conclusion of the implication (namely, Q) was false. But X had to be true. So whether X is true or false in this new assertion, something will go haywire: either it'll be true and the third and-ed thing will be false, or else it'll be false and the first and-ed thing will be false. There's no way the professor could be telling the truth here. \n At the time of this writing, all professors are human, and that's what I'll be assuming in these exercises. \n26.

For now, just realize that every set is either finite or infinite. \nYou might think, by the way, that there's no way to define an infinite set extensionally, since that would require infinite paper. This isn't true, though, if we creatively use an ellipsis: \n I = { 3 , 6 , 9 , 12 , 15 ,... } \nThis is an extensional definition of I, since we're explicitly listing all the members. It could be argued, though, that it's really intensional, since the interpretation of \"... \" requires the reader to \n2.4. SETS ARE NOT ARRAYS 13 \nfigure out the rule and mentally apply it to all remaining numbers. Perhaps in reality we are giving an intensional definition, cloaked in an extensional-looking list of members. I'm on the fence here. \n**2.4 Sets are not arrays** \nIf you've done some computer programming, you might see a resemblance between sets and the collections of items often used in a program: arrays, perhaps, or linked lists. To be sure, there are some similarities. But there are also some very important differences, which must not be overlooked: \n- **No order.** As previously mentioned, there is no order to the     members of a set. \"{Dad, Mom}\" is the same set as \"{Mom,     Dad}\". In a computer program, of course, most arrays or lists     have first, second, and last elements, and an index number     assigned to each. \n- **No duplicates.** Suppose M is the set of all males. What     would it possibly mean to say M = {T.J., T.J., Johnny}?     Would that mean that \"T.J. is twice the man that Johnny     is\"? This is obviously nonsensical. The set M is based on a     property: maleness. Each element of ohm is either male, or it     isn't. It can't be \"male three times.\" Again, in an array or     linked list, you could certainly have more than one copy of     the same item in different positions. \n- **Infinite sets.** 'Nuff said. I've never seen an array with in-     finitely many elements, and neither will you. \n- **Untyped.** Most of the time, an array or other collection in a     computer program contains elements of only a single _type_ : it's     an array of integers, or a linked list of Customer objects, for     example. This is important because the program often needs     to treat all elements in the collection the same way. Perhaps     it needs to loop over the array to add up all the numbers,     or iterate through a customer list and search for customers     who have not placed an order in the last six months. The \n14 CHAPTER 2. SETS \n program would run into problems if it tried to add a string of text to its cumulative total, or encountered a Product object in the middle of its list of Customers. Sets, though, can be heterogeneous , meaning they can contain different kinds of things. The Davies family example had all human beings, but nothing stops me from creating a set X = { Jack Nicholson, Kim Kardashian, Universal Studios, 5786,  }. I don't press this point too hard for a couple of reasons. First, most programming languages do allow heterogeneous collections of some sort, even if they're not the most natural thing to express. In Java, you can define an ArrayList as a nongeneric so that it simply holds items of class \"Object.\" In C, you can have an array of void *'s -- pointers to some unspecified type -- which allows your array to point to different kinds of things. Unless it's a loosely-typed language, though (like Perl or JavaScript), it sort of feels like you're bending over backwards to do this. The other reason I make this distinction lightly is that when we're dealing with sets, we often do find it useful to deal with things of only one type, and so our ohm ends up being homogeneous anyway. \nPerhaps the biggest thing to remember here is that a set is a purely abstract concept, whereas an array is a concrete, tangible, explicit list. When we talk about sets, we're reasoning in general about large conceptual things, whereas when we deal with arrays, we're normally iterating through them for some specific purpose. You can't iterate through a set very easily because (1) there's no order to the members, and (2) there might well be infinitely many of them anyway. \n**2.5 Sets are not ordered pairs (or tuples)** \nYou'll remember from high school algebra the notion of an **ordered pair** (x, y). We dealt with those when we wanted to specify a point to plot on a graph: the first coordinate gave the distance from the origin on the x-axis, and the second coordinate on the y-axis. Clearly an ordered pair is not a set, because as the name implies it is \n2.6. SETS OF SETS 15 \nordered: (3, -4) 6 = (- 4 , 3). For this reason, we'll be very careful to use curly braces to denote sets, and parentheses to denote ordered pairs. \nBy the way, although the word \"coordinate\" is often used to describe the elements of an ordered pair, that's really a geometrycentric word that implies a visual plot of some kind. Normally we won't be plotting elements like that, but we will still have use to deal with ordered pairs. I'll just call the constituent parts \"elements\" to make it more general. \nThree-dimensional points need **ordered triple** s (x, y, z), and it doesn't take a rocket scientist to deduce that we could extend this to any number of elements. The question is what to call them, and you _do_ sort of sound like a rocket scientist (or other generic nerd) when you say **tuple**. (Some people rhyme this word with \"Drupal,\" and others with \"couple,\" by the way, and there seems to be no consensus). If you have an ordered-pair-type thing with 5 elements, therefore, it's a 5-tuple (or a quintuple). If it has 117 elements, it's a 117-tuple, and there's really nothing else to call it. The general term (if we don't know or want to specify how many elements) is **n-tuple**. In any case, it's an ordered sequence of elements that may contain duplicates, so it's very different than a set. \n**2.6 Sets of sets** \nSets are heterogeneous -- a single set can contain four universities, seven integers, and an ahi tuna -- and so it might occur to you that they can contain other _sets_ as well. This is indeed true, but let me issue a stern warning: you can get in deep water very quickly when you start thinking about \"sets of sets.\" In 1901, in fact, the philosopher Bertrand Russell pointed out that this idea can lead to unresolvable contradictions unless you put some constraints on it. What became known as \"Russell's Paradox\" famously goes as follows: consider the set R of all sets that do _not_ have themselves \n16 CHAPTER 2. SETS \nas members^3. Now is R a member of itself, or isn't it? Either way you answer turns out to be wrong (try it!) which means that this whole setup must be flawed at some level. \nThe good news is that as long as you don't deal with this kind of self-referential loop (\"containing yourself as a member\") then it's pretty safe to try at home. Consider this set: \n V = { 3 , 5 , { 5 , 4 }, 2 }. \nThis set has _four_ (not five) members. Three of V 's members are integers: 2, 3, and 5. The other one is a set (with no name given). That other set, by the way, has two members of its own: 4 and 5. If you were asked, \"is 4  V \"? the answer would be _no_. \nAs a corollary to this, there's a difference between \n  \nand {  }. \nThe former is a set with no elements. The latter is a set with _one_ element: and that element just happens to be a set with nothing in it. \n**2.7 Cardinality** \nWhen we talk about the number of elements in a set, we use the word **cardinality**. You'd think we could just call it the \"size\" of the set, but mathematicians sometimes like words that sound cool. The cardinality of M (the set of males, where the Davies family is the domain of discourse) is 3, because there are three elements in it. The cardinality of the empty set  is 0. The cardinality of the set of all integers is . Simple as that. \n(^3) For instance, the set Z of all zebras is a member of R, since Z itself is a set (not a zebra) and so Z / Z. The set S, on the other hand, defined as \"the set of all sets mentioned in this book,\" is _not_ a member of R, since S contains itself as a member. \n2.8. SOME SPECIAL SETS 17 \nThe notation we use for cardinality is vertical bars, like with absolute value. So we write: |M | = 3. \nTo restate the example immediately above, || = 0, but |{}| = 1. \n**2.8 Some special sets** \nIn addition to the empty set, there are symbols for some other common sets, including: \n- Z -- the integers (positive, negative, and zero) \n- N -- the natural numbers (positive integers and zero) \n- Q -- the rational numbers (all numbers that can be expressed     as an integer divided by another integer) \n- R -- the real numbers (all numbers that aren't imaginary,     even decimal numbers that aren't rational) \nThe cardinality of all these sets is infinity, although as I alluded to previously, |R| is in some sense \"greater than\" |N|. For the curious, we say that N is a **countably infinite** set, whereas |R| is **uncountably infinite**. Speaking very loosely, this can be thought of this way: if we start counting up all the natural numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4,... , we will never get to the end of them. But _at least we can start counting_. With the real numbers, we can't even get off the ground. Where do you begin? Starting with 0 is fine, but then what's the \"next\" real number? Choosing anything for your second number inevitably skips a lot in between. Once you've digested this, I'll spring another shocking truth on you: |Q| is actually _equal_ to |N|, not greater than it as |R| is. Cantor came up with an ingenious numbering scheme whereby all the rational numbers -- including 3, - 9 , 174 , and - 151729 -- can be listed off regularly, in order, just like the integers can. And so |Q| = |N| 6 = |R|. This kind of stuff can blow your mind. \n18 CHAPTER 2. SETS \n**2.9 Combining sets** \nOkay, so we have sets. Now what can we do with them? When you first learn about numbers back before kindergarten, the next thing you learn is how to combine numbers using various operations to produce other numbers. These include +, -, x, /, exponents, roots, _etc._ Sets, too, have operations that are useful for combining to make other sets. These include: \n- **Union** (). The union of two sets is a set that includes the     elements that _either (or both)_ of them have as members. For     instance, if A = { Dad, Lizzy }, and B = { Lizzy, T.J., Johnny     }, then A  B = { Dad, Lizzy, T.J., Johnny }. Note that an     element is in the union if it is in A _or_ B. For this reason,     there is a strong relationship between the union operator of     sets and the \"or\" () operator of boolean logic that we'll see     later. \n- **Intersection** (). The intersection of two sets is a set that     includes the elements that _both_ of them have as members. In     the above example, A  B = { Lizzy }. There is a strong     connection between intersection and the \"and\" () boolean     logic operator. \n- **(Partial) complement** (-). Looks like subtraction, but sig-     nificantly different. A - B contains _the elements from A that_     _are not also in B_. So you start with A, and then \"subtract off\"     the contents of B, if they occur. In the above example, A - B     = { Dad }. (Note that T.J. and Johnny didn't really enter in     to the calculation.) Unlike  and , - is not **commutative**.     This means it's not symmetrical: A - B doesn't (normally)     give the same answer as B - A. In this example, B - A is     { T.J., Johnny }, whereas if you ever reverse the operands     with union or intersection, you'll always get the same result     as before. \n- **(Total) complement** (X). Same as the partial complement,     above, except that the implied first operand is ohm. In other     words, A-B is \"all the things in A that aren't in B,\" whereas \n2.9.

Although you will be \"rewriting\" in this exercise, you are not abandoning your earlier draft: this exercise is generative, meaning it is designed to help you produce new details, ideas, or surprising bits of language that you might integrate into your project. First, choose a part of your draft that (1) you really like but think could be better or (2) just isn't working for you. This excerpt should be no fewer than one hundred words and can include your entire essay, if you want. 127 COLLECTED WORKS \nThen complete your choice of one prompt from the list below: apply the instruction to the excerpt to create new content. _Read over your original once, but do not refer back to it after you start writing. Your goal here is to deviate from the first version, not reproduce it._ The idea here is to produce something new about your topic through constraint; you are reimagining your excerpt on a global scale. After completing one prompt, go back to the original and try at least one more or apply a different prompt to your new work. \n**1.** _Change genres._ For example, if your excerpt is written in typical essay form, try     writing it as poetry, or dialogue from a play/movie, or a radio advertisement. \n**2.** _Zoom in._ Focus on one image, color, idea, or word from your excerpt and     zoom way in. Meditate on this one thing with as much detail as possible. \n**3.** _Zoom out._ Step back from the excerpt and contextualize it with background     information, concurrent events, or information about relationships or     feelings. \n**4.** _Change point of view._ Try a new vantage point for your story by changing     pronouns and perspective. For instance, if your excerpt is in first person (I/     me), switch to second (you) or third person (he/she/they). \n**5.** _Change setting._ Resituate your excerpt in a different place or time. \n**6.** _Change your audience._ Rewrite the excerpt anticipating the expectations of a     different reader than you first intended. For example, if the original excerpt is     in the same speaking voice you would use with your friends, write as if your     strictest teacher or the president or your grandmother is reading it. If you've     written in an \"academic\" voice, try writing for your closest friend--use slang,     swear words, casual language, whatever. \n**7.** _Add another voice._ Instead of just the speaker of the essay narrating, add a     listener. This listener can agree, disagree, question, heckle, sympathize,     apologize, or respond in any other way you can imagine. \n**8.** _Change timeline (narrative sequence)._ Instead of moving chronologically     forward, rearrange the events to bounce around. \n**9.** _Change tense._ Narrate from a different vantage point by changing the     grammar. For example, instead of writing in past tense, write in present or     future tense. \n**10.** _Change tone._ Reimagine your writing in a different emotional register. For     instance, if your writing is predominantly nostalgic, try a bitter tone. If you     seem regretful, try to write as if you were proud.        A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 128 \n##### Reverse Outlining \n Have you ever written an outline before writing a draft? It can be a useful prewriting strategy, but it doesn't work for all writers. If you're like me, you prefer to brain-dump a bunch of ideas on the paper, then come back to organize and refocus during the revision process. One strategy that can help you here is reverse outlining. Divide a blank piece of paper into three columns, as demonstrated below. Number each paragraph of your draft, and write an equal numbered list down the left column of your blank piece of paper. Write \"Idea\" at the top of the middle column and \"Purpose\" at the top of the right column. Table 16.3 A worksheet example for reverse formatting \n##### Paragraph Number (P#) \n##### Idea \n##### (What is the P saying?) \n##### Purpose \n##### (What is the P doing?) \n##### Paragraph 1 Notes:^ Notes: \n##### Paragraph 2 Notes:^ Notes: \n##### Paragraph 3 Notes:^ Notes: \n##### Paragraph 4 Notes:^ Notes: \n##### Paragraph 5 Notes:^ Notes: \n##### Paragraph 6 Notes:^ Notes: \n##### Paragraph 7 Notes:^ Notes: \n Now wade back through your essay, identifying what each paragraph is saying and what each paragraph is doing. Choose a few key words or phrases for each column to record on your sheet of paper.  Try to use consistent language throughout the reverse outline so you can see where your paragraphs are saying or doing similar things.  A paragraph might have too many different ideas or too many different functions for you to concisely identify. This could be a sign that you need to divide that paragraph up. Here's a student's model reverse outline: 129 COLLECTED WORKS \n Table 16.4 A model of a reverse outline \n##### Paragraph \n##### Number (P) \n##### Idea \n##### (What is the P saying?) \n##### Purpose \n##### (What is the P doing?) \n##### Paragraph 1 \n Theater is an important part of education and childhood development.

Call to action, backing up and restating thesis But wait--there's more! Once you have identified the idea(s) and purpose(s) of each paragraph, you can start revising according to your observations. From the completed reverse outline, create a new outline with a different sequence, organization, focus, or balance. You can reorganize by  combining or dividing paragraphs,  rearranging ideas, and  adding or subtracting content. Reverse outlining can also be helpful in identifying gaps and redundancies: Now that you have a new outline, do any of your ideas seem too brief? Do you need more evidence for a certain argument? Do you see ideas repeated more than necessary? After completing the reverse outline above, the student proposed this new organization: 16.5 Student proposed changes based on previous table \n##### Proposed changes based on reverse outline: \n 1 4a 4b Combine 2 and 5a Combine 3 and 6 5b Write new paragraph on other solutions 7 You might note that this strategy can also be applied on the sentence and section level. Additionally, if you are a kinesthetic or visual learner, you might cut your paper into smaller pieces that you can physically manipulate. A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 130 \n Be sure to read aloud after reverse outlining to look for abrupt transitions. You can see a simplified version of this technique demonstrated in this video. \n##### Local Revision Activity: Cutting Fluff \n When it's late at night, the deadline is approaching, and we've simply run out of things to say...we turn to fluff. Fluff refers to language that doesn't do work for you--language that simply takes up space or sits flat on the page rather than working economically and impactfully. Whether or not you've used it deliberately, all authors have been guilty of fluffy writing at one time or another. Example of fluff on social media [\"Presidents don't have to be smart\" from funnyjunk.com]. Fluff happens for a lot of reasons.  Of course, reaching a word or page count is the most common motivation.  Introductions and conclusions are often fluffy because the author can't find a way into or out of the subject or because the author doesn't know what their exact subject will be.  Sometimes, the presence of fluff is an indication that the author doesn't know enough about the subject or that their scope is too broad.  Other times, fluffy language is deployed in an effort to sound \"smarter\" or \"fancier\" or \"more academic\"--which is an understandable pitfall for developing writers. These circumstances, plus others, encourage us to use language that's not as effective, authentic, or economical. Fluff happens in a lot of ways; here are a few I've noticed: 131 COLLECTED WORKS \n Table 16.6 A list of common fluff origin stories \n##### Fluff's \n##### Supervillainous \n##### Alter-Ego \n##### Supervillain Origin Story \n##### Thesaurus \n##### syndrome \n A writer uses inappropriately complex language (often because of the right-click \"Synonyms\" function) to achieve a different tone. The more complex language might be used inaccurately or sound inauthentic because the author isn't as familiar with it. \n##### Roundabout \n##### phrasing \n Rather than making a direct statement (\"That man is a fool.\"), the author uses couching language or beats around the bush (\"If one takes into account each event, each decision, it would not be unwise for one to suggest that that man's behaviors are what some would call foolish.\") \n##### Abstraction or \n##### generalities \n If the author hasn't quite figured out what they want to say or has too broad of a scope, they might discuss an issue very generally without committing to specific, engaging details. \n##### Digression \n An author might get off topic, accidentally or deliberately, creating extraneous, irrelevant, or unconnected language. \n##### Ornamentation \n##### or flowery \n##### language \n Similarly to thesaurus syndrome, often referred to as \"purple prose,\" an author might choose words that sound pretty or smart but aren't necessarily the right words for their ideas. \n##### Wordy \n##### sentences \n Even if the sentences an author creates are grammatically correct, they might be wordier than necessary. Of course, there's a very fine line between detail and fluff. Avoiding fluff doesn't mean always using the fewest words possible. Instead, you should occasionally ask yourself in the revision process, How is this part contributing to the whole? Is this somehow building toward a bigger purpose? If the answer is no, then you need to revise. The goal should not necessarily be \"Don't write fluff\" but rather \"Learn to get rid of fluff in revision.\" In light of our focus on process, you are allowed to write fluff in the drafting period, so long as you learn to \"prune\" during revisions. (I use the word prune as an analogy for caring for a plant: just as you must cut the dead leaves off for the plant's health and growth, you will need to cut fluff so your writing can thrive.) Here are a few strategies:  Read out loud.  Ask yourself what a sentence is doing, rhetorically.  Combine like sentences, phrases, or ideas.  Use signposts, like topic-transition sentences (for yourself during revision and for your reader in the final draft).  Be specific--stay cognizant of your scope (globally) and the detail of your writing (locally). To practice revising for fluff, workshop the following excerpt by yourself or with a partner. Your goal is not to cut back to the smallest number of words but rather to prune out what you consider to be fluff and leave what you consider to be detail. You should be able to explain the choices you make.

There was a time long before today when an event occurred involving a young woman who was known to the world as Goldilocks. On the particular day at hand, Goldilocks made a spontaneous decision to wander through the forest, the trees growing up high above her flowing blonde pigtails. Some time after she commenced her voyage, but not after too long, she saw sitting on the horizon a small residency. Goldilocks rapped her knuckles on the door, but alas, no one answered the door. Therefore, Goldilocks decided that it would be a good idea to enter the unattended house, so she entered it. Atop the average-sized table in the kitchen of the house, there were three bowls of porridge, which is similar to oatmeal. Porridge is a very common dish in Europe; in fact, the Queen of England is well known for enjoying at least one daily bowl of porridge per day. Goldilocks, not unlike the Queen of England, enjoys eating porridge for its nutritional value. On this day, she was feeling quite hungry and wanted to eat. She decided that she should taste one of the three bowls of porridge, from which steam was rising indicating its temperature.

We will see in the second half of the course (Chapter D, Chapter E, Chapter LT, Chapter R) that these matrices are especially important. \n##### Subsection NM \n##### Nonsingular Matrices \nOur theorems will now establish connections between systems of equations (homogeneous or otherwise), augmented matrices representing those systems, coefficient matrices, constant vectors, the reduced row-echelon form of matrices (augmented and coefficient) and solution sets. Be very careful in your reading, writing and speaking about systems of equations, matrices and sets of vectors. A system of equations is not a matrix, a matrix is not a solution set, and a solution set is not a system of equations. Now would be a great time to review the discussion about speaking and writing mathematics in Proof Technique L. Definition SQM Square Matrix A matrix with m rows and n columns is square if m = n. In this case, we say the matrix has size n. To emphasize the situation when a matrix is not square, we will call it rectangular. \u0003 We can now present one of the central definitions of linear algebra. Definition NM Nonsingular Matrix Suppose A is a square matrix. Suppose further that the solution set to the homogeneous linear system of equations LS(A, 0 ) is { 0 }, in other words, the system has only the trivial solution. Then we say that A is a nonsingular matrix. Otherwise we say A is a singular matrix. \u0003 We can investigate whether any square matrix is nonsingular or not, no matter if the matrix is derived somehow from a system of equations or if it is simply a matrix. The definition says that to perform this investigation we must construct a very specific system of equations (homogeneous, with the matrix as the coefficient matrix) and look at its solution set. We will have theorems in this section that connect nonsingular matrices with systems of equations, creating more opportunities for confusion. Convince yourself now of two observations, (1) we can decide nonsingularity for any square matrix, and (2) the determination of nonsingularity involves the solution set for a certain homogeneous system of equations. Notice that it makes no sense to call a system of equations nonsingular (the term does not apply to a system of equations), nor does it make any sense to call a 5 x 7 matrix singular (the matrix is not square). Example S A singular matrix, Archetype A Example HISAA shows that the coefficient matrix derived from Archetype A, specifically the 3 x 3 matrix, \n A = \n [ 1 - 1 2 2 1 1 1 1 0 \n ] \n is a singular matrix since there are nontrivial solutions to the homogeneous system LS(A, 0 ). 4 \n SSN M B e e z e r : A F i r s t C o u r s e i n L i n e a r A l g e b r a 54 \n Example NM A nonsingular matrix, Archetype B Example HUSAB shows that the coefficient matrix derived from Archetype B, specifically the 3 x 3 matrix, \n B = \n [- 7 - 6 - 12 5 5 7 1 0 4 \n ] \n is a nonsingular matrix since the homogeneous system, LS(B, 0 ) , has only the trivial solution. 4 Notice that we will not discuss Example HISAD as being a singular or nonsingular coefficient matrix since the matrix is not square. The next theorem combines with our main computational technique (row reducing a matrix) to make it easy to recognize a nonsingular matrix. But first a definition. Definition IM Identity Matrix The m x m identity matrix, Im, is defined by \n [Im]ij = \n { 1 i = j 0 i 6 = j \n 1 <= i, j <= m \n \u0003 Example IM An identity matrix The 4 x 4 identity matrix is \n I 4 = \n    \n 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 \n   . \n4 Notice that an identity matrix is square, and in reduced row-echelon form. Also, every column is a pivot column, and every possible pivot column appears once. Theorem NMRRI Nonsingular Matrices Row Reduce to the Identity matrix Suppose that A is a square matrix and B is a row-equivalent matrix in reduced row-echelon form. Then A is nonsingular if and only if B is the identity matrix. \n Proof. (=) Suppose B is the identity matrix. When the augmented matrix [ A | 0 ] is row-reduced, the result is [ B | 0 ] = [ In | 0 ]. The number of nonzero rows is equal to the number of variables in the linear system of equations LS(A, 0 ), so n = r and Theorem FVCS gives n - r = 0 free variables. Thus, the homogeneous system LS(A, 0 ) has just one solution, which must be the trivial solution. This is exactly the definition of a nonsingular matrix (Definition NM). (=) If A is nonsingular, then the homogeneous system LS(A, 0 ) has a unique solution, and has no free variables in the description of the solution set. The homogeneous system is consistent (Theorem HSC) so Theorem FVCS applies and tells us there are n - r free variables. Thus, n - r = 0, and so n = r. So B has n pivot columns among its total of n columns. This is enough to force B to be the n x n identity matrix In (see Exercise NM.T12). \u0004 \nNotice that since this theorem is an equivalence it will always allow us to determine if a matrix is either nonsingular or singular. Here are two examples of this, continuing our study of Archetype A and Archetype B. Example SRR Singular matrix, row-reduced We have the coefficient matrix for Archetype A and a row-equivalent matrix B in \n SSN M B e e z e r : A F i r s t C o u r s e i n L i n e a r A l g e b r a 55 \n reduced row-echelon form, \n A = \n [ 1 - 1 2 2 1 1 1 1 0 \n ] RREF ----- \n   \n 1 0 1 0 1 - 1 0 0 0 \n  \n (^) = B Since B is not the 3 x 3 identity matrix, Theorem NMRRI tells us that A is a singular matrix. 4 Example NSR Nonsingular matrix, row-reduced We have the coefficient matrix for Archetype B and a row-equivalent matrix B in reduced row-echelon form, A = [- 7 - 6 - 12 5 5 7 1 0 4 ] RREF -----   1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1   (^) = B Since B is the 3 x 3 identity matrix, Theorem NMRRI tells us that A is a nonsingular matrix. 4 \n##### Subsection NSNM \n##### Null Space of a Nonsingular Matrix \n Nonsingular matrices and their null spaces are intimately related, as the next two examples illustrate. Example NSS Null space of a singular matrix Given the singular coefficient matrix from Archetype A, the null space is the set of solutions to the homogeneous system of equations LS(A, 0 ) has a solution set and null space constructed in Example HISAA as an infinite set of vectors. \n A = \n [ 1 - 1 2 2 1 1 1 1 0 \n ] N (A) = \n { [ -x 3 x 3 x 3 \n ]| | | | | \n x 3  C \n } \n 4 Example NSNM Null space of a nonsingular matrix Given the nonsingular coefficient matrix from Archetype B, the solution set to the homogeneous system LS(A, 0 ) is constructed in Example HUSAB and contains only the trivial solution, so the null space of A has only a single element, \n A = \n [ - 7 - 6 - 12 5 5 7 1 0 4 \n ] N (A) = \n {[ 0 0 0 \n ]} \n4 These two examples illustrate the next theorem, which is another equivalence. Theorem NMTNS Nonsingular Matrices have Trivial Null Spaces Suppose that A is a square matrix. Then A is nonsingular if and only if the null space of A is the set containing only the zero vector, i.e. N (A) = { 0 }. \n Proof. The null space of a square matrix, A, is equal to the set of solutions to the homogeneous system, LS(A, 0 ). A matrix is nonsingular if and only if the set of solutions to the homogeneous system, LS(A, 0 ), has only a trivial solution. These two observations may be chained together to construct the two proofs necessary for each half of this theorem. \u0004 \n SSN M B e e z e r : A F i r s t C o u r s e i n L i n e a r A l g e b r a 56 \nThe next theorem pulls a lot of big ideas together. Theorem NMUS tells us that we can learn much about solutions to a system of linear equations with a square coefficient matrix by just examining a similar homogeneous system. Theorem NMUS Nonsingular Matrices and Unique Solutions Suppose that A is a square matrix. A is a nonsingular matrix if and only if the system LS(A, b) has a unique solution for every choice of the constant vector b. \nProof. (=) The hypothesis for this half of the proof is that the system LS(A, b) has a unique solution for every choice of the constant vector b. We will make a very specific choice for b: b = 0. Then we know that the system LS(A, 0 ) has a unique solution. But this is precisely the definition of what it means for A to be nonsingular (Definition NM). That almost seems too easy! Notice that we have not used the full power of our hypothesis, but there is nothing that says we must use a hypothesis to its fullest. (=) We assume that A is nonsingular of size n x n, so we know there is a sequence of row operations that will convert A into the identity matrix In (Theorem NMRRI). Form the augmented matrix A'^ = [ A | b] and apply this same sequence of row operations to A'. The result will be the matrix B'^ = [ In | c] , which is in reduced row-echelon form with r = n. Then the augmented matrix B'^ represents the (extremely simple) system of equations xi = [c]i, 1 <= i <= n. The vector c is clearly a solution, so the system is consistent (Definition CS).

Frequently, the students who entered college best prepared were those who were already middle or upper class, meaning the opportunities the workingand lower-class students received were more limited (Armstrong and Hamilton 1-26). When you look at this alongside what Gloria Ladson-Billings calls the _educational debt_ , or the compounded impact of educational deficits that grow across generations of poor minority students, literacy efforts as they are currently framed paint a bleak picture for poor minority students (3-12). The issue is not just one of unequal access to opportunities. Jacqueline Jones Royster and Carmen Kynard illustrate how attitudes toward students as writers are interwoven with attitudes toward them as people. Language cannot be disassociated from people, which has important consequences for those who grow up speaking different dialects. By continuing to propagate the notion of correct and incorrect ways of speaking, we effectively devalue the intelligence and character of students, employees, and colleagues who, for whatever reasons, don't speak or write what in historical terms has been called the King's English (among other names). We use the perception of improper communication as evidence of others' lesser character or ability, despite recognizing that this country was united (if only in name) after declaring independence from that king (Kynard; Royster). This perception becomes all the more problematic because it is about not just devaluing individuals but the widespread practice of devaluing the literate practices of those who are already marginalized. David Gold highlights how the literacy of African Americans, women, and working-class and rural people has been marginalized in our understanding of writing. Gold writes about how the literacy practices of African Americans in universities laid the groundwork for the civil rights movement. Indeed, the schools he studied were decades ahead of the larger national conversation on how literacy, identity, and power were interrelated. In her work examining how literacy and identity formation were key for African American women and for social change, Jacqueline Jones Royster discusses the importance of understanding these cultural, identity, and social movements, echoing the impact marginalized scholars had A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 18 \nin academia. Both demonstrate the detrimental impact of sidelining groups of people and their literate practices by devaluing their languages and their experiences, not just for those who are marginalized but for our larger understanding of how we as a society write. The notion of one correct way of writing is also troubling because it operates under the assumption that linguistic differences are the result of error. The reality is that for many speakers, what we might perceive as a mistake is actually a system of difference. One notable example of a different dialect of English is Ebonics, which has different patterns of speech rooted in the ancestral heritage of its speakers. Similarly, immigrant groups will frequently speak and write English in a way that mirrors the linguistic heritage of their mother tongue. The way that we conceptualize language is not just detrimental to minorities; it also devalues the identities that workingand lower-class people bring to communicative situations, including the classroom. Lynn Z. Bloom writes that \"Freshman Composition is an unabashedly middle-class enterprise.\" She argues that one of the reasons composition is required for all students is because it promulgates middle-class values and ways of thinking. These values in the writing classroom are embodied in everything from the notion of property, which undergirds the way that plagiarism and intellectual property are treated, to the formality of language and rhetorical choices that are encouraged in papers (654-675). Indeed, the way many instructors teach writing, plagiarism, citation, and word choice in papers is not in and of itself good but rather is the socially accepted way of interacting with text as defined by the middle class. Mike Rose and Irvin Peckham often write about the tension of middle-class values on working-class students and the cognitive dissonance and struggles with identity that come with imposing such values in writing under the guise of correctness. The idea that there is one correct way of writing devalues the writing, thoughts, intelligence, and identities of people from lower-class backgrounds. Pragmatically, many argue that standard English should be dominant in the binary between academic English and all other dialects in order for speakers and writers to communicate with credibility in their communities. This argument has been used to justify the continued attention to correctness at the expense of authors' voices, but we can teach people to adapt while also valuing their identities. We can talk about writing as something that they can employ to their benefit rather than a hegemonic standard that supersedes their backgrounds, identities, and experiences. In order to value the diversity of communication and identities that exist in the US, we need to start teaching and envisioning writing as a cultural and social activity. We need a more nuanced view of writing in society that encourages everyone to adapt to their audiences and contexts rather than placing an undue burden on those who do not fit the mold of standard English. One strategy for teaching academic English without devaluing a writer's identity is codeswitching, a concept already taught in schools with significant minority populations as a way of empowering young people. While instruction in code-switching is valuable because it teaches students that they can adopt different linguistic choices to appeal to different audiences, it is deeply problematic that the impetus is still placed on minority students with nonstandard dialects to adapt. While code-switching is meant to empower people, it is still rooted in the mentality that there is one correct way of writing, because even as code-switching teaches an incredibly nuanced way of thinking about writing, it is still being taught in the context 19 COLLECTED WORKS \nof preparing writers to deal with a society that will use errors in speaking as evidence that they are lesser. As a result, it is a less-than-ideal solution because it plays into--rather than undermines--the racism of academic English. By perpetuating the myth of one correct way of writing, we are effectively marginalizing substantial swaths of the population linguistically and culturally. The first step in combating this is as easy as recognizing how correctness reinforces inequality and affects our own perceptions of people and questioning our assumptions about communication, and a second step is valuing code-switching in a wide swath of communicative situations.

Patricia Bizzell,     Helen Fox, and Christopher Shroeder compile arguments for addressing     these other types of communication in _Alt Dis: Alternative Discourses and the_     _Academy_. \n**2.** In _College Writing and Beyond_ , Anne Beaufort provides a framework in     which to understand how writing is dynamic. In her article \"Freshman     Composition as a Middle-Class Enterprise,\" Lynn Z. Bloom articulates the     ways in which the cultural values of the middle class are being taught in the     writing classroom as objectively good or true and the impact of this     mentality. Additionally, Asao Inoue compiles a collection of articles in _Race_     _and Writing Assessment_ that provides frameworks for considering race in     assessment practices. \n**3.** In 1974, the Conference for College Composition and Communication     passed the resolution _Students' Right to Their Own Language_. In the time     since it passed, there has been a great deal of discussion around the     wisdom of that resolution. Editors Austin Jackson, David E. Kirkland, and     Staci Perryman-Clark compile short articles for and against this resolution. \n**4.** Bruce Horner, Min-Zhan Lu, Jacqueline Jones Royster, and John Trimbur     write about how the increasing number of English speakers in the world is     increasing linguistic diversity in \"Opinion: Language Difference in Writing:     Toward a Translingual Approach.\" Additionally, Irvin Peckham writes     extensively with a focus on working-class students in the classroom and     the impact of college and academic writing as a middle-class enterprise in     \"The Stories We Tell.\" For more on the history and cultural development of     African American Vernacular English, consider _Beyond Ebonics: Linguistic_     _Pride and Racial Prejudice_ by John Baugh. \n#### ADDITIONAL RESOURCES \n A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 22 \n Armstrong, Elizabeth A., and Laura T.

What I normally do just isn't working!\" That's a familiar feeling for all writers. Sometimes the writing just seems to flow as if by magic, but then the flow stops cold. Your brain seems to have run out of things to say. If you just wait for the magic to come back, you might wait a long time. What professional writers know is that writing takes consistent effort. Writing comes out of a regular practice--a habit. Professional writers also know that not everything they write ends up in the final draft. Sometimes we have to write what Anne Lamott calls a \"shitty first draft.\" One of my favorite writing professors, Duncan Carter, used to say that he was a terrible writer but a great reviser, and that's what helped him write when inspiration wasn't available. So how do writers get going when they feel stuck or uninspired? They develop a set of habits and have more than one way to write to get the words flowing again. You might associate the idea of writing anxiety or writer's block with procrastination, and procrastination certainly can be either a cause or an effect of writing anxiety. But writing anxiety or writer's block is more of a condition or state of being. We'll start by defining the term--so that you can figure out if you have it--and then cover some ways to work through it. Do you worry excessively about writing assignments? Do they make you feel uneasy or agitated? Do you have negative feelings about certain types of writing? If you answered yes to any of these questions, you might be dealing with writing anxiety. Writing anxiety simply means that a writer is experiencing negative feelings about a given writing task. Writing anxiety is often more about the audience and/or purpose for a given writing task than it is about the mere act of writing itself. Say you just bought a new pair of headphones. You brought them home, removed all the packaging, and connected them to your phone, and they're \n#### WHAT IS WRITING ANXIETY AND HOW DO YOU KNOW IF YOU HAVE IT? \n A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 24 \n amazing! So you decide to visit the company website, and you write a stellar review of the product, giving it a five-star rating and including descriptive details about the headphones' comfortable fit, excellent sound quality, ability to cancel outside noise, and reasonable price. Now let's say that the next day in biology class, your instructor covers the topic of biomes, and you learn about animal habitats and biodiversity and the interrelation and interdependence of species within biomes.

LOGIC \nSo these two cases both result in true. But perhaps surprisingly, we also get true for oatmeal: \n Human(oatmeal) = Adult(oatmeal)  Child(oatmeal) false = false  false false = false true X \nWhoa, how did _true_ pop out of that? Simply because the premise was false, and so all bets were off. We effectively said \" _if_ a bowl of oatmeal is human, _then_ it will either be an adult or a child. But it's not, so never mind.\" Put another way, the bowl of oatmeal did _not_ turn out to be a counterexample, and so we're confident claiming that this expression is true \"for _all_ h\": h. \nThe other kind of quantifier is called the **existential quantifier**. As its name suggests, it asserts the _existence_ of something. We write it \"\" and pronounce it \"there exists.\" For example, \n x HasGovernor(x) \nasserts that there is _at least one_ state that has a governor. This doesn't tell us how _many_ states this is true for, and in fact despite their name, quantifiers really aren't very good at \"quantifying\" things for us, at least numerically. As of 2008, the statement \n x President(x)  African-American(x) \nis true, and always will be, no matter how many more AfricanAmerican U.S. presidents we have. Note that in compound expressions like this, a variable (like x) always stands for a _single_ entity wherever it appears. For hundreds of years there have existed African-Americans, and there have existed Presidents, so the expression above would be ridiculously obvious if it meant only \"there have been Presidents, and there have been African-Americans.\" But the same variable x being used as inputs to _both_ predicates is what seals the deal and makes it represent the much stronger statement \"there is at least one individual who is personally _both_ AfricanAmerican _and_ President of the United States at the same time.\" \n8.2. PREDICATE LOGIC 215 \nIt's common practice to negate quantifiers, both universal and existential. As of 2022, the following statement is still true: \n !p President(p)  Female(p). \nThis conveys that there does _not_ exist a female president. As another example, if one day Missouri overhauls its government structure and replaces it with a mobocracy, perhaps we'll state: \n !x HasGovernor(x). \n**Interchanging quantifiers** \nSome illuminating themes can be seen when we examine the relationship that the two types of quantifiers have to each other. Consider this one first:^3 \n x P (x) = !x !P (x), (8.1) \nwhere P is any predicate (or for that matter, any expression involving many predicates). That's sensible. It states: \"if P is true of all things, then there does _not_ exist anything that it _isn't_ true for.\" Three other equivalences come to light:^4 \n !x P (x) = x !P (x) (8.2) x !P (x) = !x P (x) (8.3) !x !P (x) = x P (x) (8.4) \nIn words, identity 8.2 says \"if it's not true for everything, then it must be false for something.\" Identity 8.3 says \"if it's false for everything, then there's nothing it's true for.\" And identity 8.4 says \"if it's not false for everything, then it must be true for something.\" All of these are eminently logical, I think you'll agree. They also imply that there are nearly always multiple correct ways to state something. In our apocalyptic vision of Missouri, for example, we stated \"!x HasGovernor(x),\" but we could just as well have stated \"x !HasGovernor(x),\" which amounts to the same thing. \n(^3) (8.1) Everybody was driving. = Nobody exists who was not driving. (^4) (8.2) Not everybody was driving. = At least one person was not driving. (8.3) Everybody was not driving. = Nobody was driving. (8.4) Not everybody was not driving. = At least one person was driving. \n216 CHAPTER 8. LOGIC \n**Order matters** \nWhen you're facing an intimidating morass of 's and 's and 's and ='s and God knows what else, it's easy to get lost in the sauce. But you have to be very careful to dissect the expression to find out what it means. Consider this one: \n x  Ry  R x + 1 = y. (8.5) \nThis statement is _true_. It says that for every single real number (call it x), it's true that you can find some other number (call it y) that's one greater than it. If you generate some examples it's easy to see this is true. Suppose we have the real number x = 5. Is there some other number y that's equal to x + 1? Of course, the number 6. What if x = - 32. 4? Is there a number y that satisfies this equation? Of course, y = - 31. 4. Obviously no matter what number x we choose, we can find the desired number y just by adding one. Hence this statement is true _for all_ x, just like it says. \nWhat happens, though, if we innocently switch the order of the quantifiers? Let's try asserting this: \n y  Rx  R x + 1 = y. (8.6) \nIs this also true? Look carefully. It says \"there exists some magic number y that has the following amazing property: no matter what value of x you choose, this y is one greater than x!\" Obviously this is not true. There _is_ no such number y. If I choose y = 13, that works great as long as I choose x = 12, but for any other choice of x, it's dead in the water. \nThe lesson learned here is that the order of quantifiers matters. You have to take each quantifier/variable pair in turn, and think to yourself, \"okay, this statement is asserting that _once I choose_ the first variable, the rest of the expression is true for that choice.\" \n**The value of precision** \nThis fluency with the basic syntax and meaning of predicate logic was our only goal in this chapter. There are all kinds of logical rules that can be applied to predicate logic statements in order to \n8.2. PREDICATE LOGIC 217 \ndeduce further statements, and you'll learn about them when you study artificial intelligence later on. Most of them are formalized versions of common sense. \"If you know A is true, and you know A=B is true, then you can conclude B is true.\" Or \"if you know XY is false, and then you discover that Y is true, you can then conclude that X is false.\" _Etc._ The power to produce new truth from existing truth is the hallmark of AI systems, and why this stuff really matters. \nIf you can imagine a program doing this sort of automated reasoning, it will become clear why the precision of something like predicate logic -- instead of the sloppiness of English -- becomes important. English is a beautiful and poetic language, but its ambiguity is notorious. For example, back in chapter 3 we used the phrase \"some employee belongs to every department\" when describing relations. Now consider that English sentence. What does \"some employee belongs to every department\" actually mean? Does it mean that there is some special employee who happens to hold membership in every department in the company? Or does it mean that no department is empty: all departments have at least _one_ person in them, for crying out loud? The English could mean either. In predicate logic, we're either asserting: \n x Employee(x)  y BelongsTo(x, y) \nor y x Employee(x)  BelongsTo(x, y) \nThese are two very different things. A human being would realize that it's the second one the speaker means, drawing from a whole range of experience and common sense and context clues. But a 'bot has available none of these, and so it demands that the language clearly and unambiguously state exactly what's meant. \nEnglish is rife with these ambiguities, especially involving pronouns. \" **After John hit George he ran away.** \" What happened? Did John run away after striking George, fearing that George would retaliate? Or did George run away after getting hit, fearing additional abuse? It's unclear what \"he\" refers to, so we can't say from the sentence alone. \n218 CHAPTER 8. LOGIC \nHere's a funny one I'll end with. Consider the sentence \" **He made her duck** .\" What is intended here? Did some guy reach out with his hand and forcefully push a woman's head down out of the way of a screaming projectile? Or did he prepare a succulent dish of roasted fowl to celebrate her birthday? Oh, if the computer could only know. If we'd used predicate logic instead of English, it could! \n 8.3. EXERCISES 219 \n**8.3 Exercises** \n Let B be the proposition that Joe Biden was elected president in 2020, C be the proposition that Covid-19 was completely and permanently eradicated from the earth in 2021, and R be the proposition that Roe v. Wade was overturned in 2022. \n1. What's B  C? \n True. \n2. What's B  C? False. \n3. What's B  R? True. \n4. What's B  !R? False. \n5. What's !C  !R? True. \n6. What's !(C  !R)? True. \n7.

What's B  C  R? True. \n15. What's B  C  R? False. \n16. What's B  !C  R? True. \n17. What's B = R? \n True. (Even though there is plainly no causality there.) \n18. What's R = B? True. (Ditto.) \n19. What's B = C? \n False. (The premise is true, so the conclusion must also be true for this sentence to be true.) \n20. What's C = B? \n True. (The premise is false, so all bets are off and the sentence is true.) \n 220 CHAPTER 8. LOGIC \n21. What's C = !R? \n True. (The premise is false, so all bets are off and the sentence is true.) \n22. What's C = B? \n False. (The truth values of the left and right sides are not the same.) \n23. What's C = !B? \n True. (The truth values of the left and right sides are the same.) \n24. I make this assertion: \n \"X  !Y  !(Z = Q).\" And since I'm the professor, you can assume I'm correct about this. From this information alone, can you determine a unique set of values for the four variables? Or is there more than one possibility for them? \n There is actually only one solution. Here's one way to tell. We know that X must be true, since it's being \"and-ed\" in to another expression. We know that Y must be false, since its opposite is similarly being \"anded\" in. Finally, we also know that Z must be true and Q must be false, since the only way an implication (=) can be false is if its premise is true and its conclusion is false. And the implication here must be false if the professor is telling the truth, because its opposite is being \"and-ed\" in to the three other things. So the one and only answer is: X = 1, Y = 0, Z = 1, Q = 0. (You can figure this all out with truth tables too, of course, and for most examples you would. I just wanted to make an exercise that you could figure out in your head without pencil and paper.) \n25. What if I get rid of Q and replace     it with X, thus making my asser-     tion:        \"X  !Y  !(Z = X).\"     Now what is/are the solutions? \n Now it's impossible, and if you study the previous item, you'll see why. The only way that item 24 could be true was if the conclusion of the implication (namely, Q) was false. But X had to be true. So whether X is true or false in this new assertion, something will go haywire: either it'll be true and the third and-ed thing will be false, or else it'll be false and the first and-ed thing will be false. There's no way the professor could be telling the truth here. \n At the time of this writing, all professors are human, and that's what I'll be assuming in these exercises. \n26. True or false: x Professor(x). \n False.

You have probably heard the word \"algebra\" frequently in your mathematical preparation for this course. Most likely, you have spent a good ten to fifteen years learning the algebra of the real numbers, along with some introduction to the very similar algebra of complex numbers (see Section CNO). However, there are many new algebras to learn and use, and likely linear algebra will be your second algebra. Like learning a second language, the necessary adjustments can be challenging at times, but the rewards are many. And it will make learning your third and fourth algebras even easier. Perhaps you have heard of \"groups\" and \"rings\" (or maybe you have studied them already), which are excellent examples of other algebras with very interesting properties and applications. In any event, prepare yourself to learn a new algebra and realize that some of the old rules you used for the real numbers may no longer apply to this new algebra you will be learning! The brief discussion above about lines and planes suggests that linear algebra has an inherently geometric nature, and this is true. Examples in two and three dimensions can be used to provide valuable insight into important concepts of this course. However, much of the power of linear algebra will be the ability to work with \"flat\" or \"straight\" objects in higher dimensions, without concerning ourselves with visualizing the situation. While much of our intuition will come from examples in two and three dimensions, we will maintain an algebraic approach to the subject, with the geometry being secondary. Others may wish to switch this emphasis around, and that can lead to a very fruitful and beneficial course, but here and now we are laying our bias bare. \n##### Subsection AA \n##### An Application \n We conclude this section with a rather involved example that will highlight some of the power and techniques of linear algebra. Work through all of the details with pencil and paper, until you believe all the assertions made. However, in this introductory example, do not concern yourself with how some of the results are obtained or how you might be expected to solve a similar problem. We will come back to this example later and expose some of the techniques used and properties exploited. For now, use your background in mathematics to convince yourself that everything said here really is correct. Example TMP Trail Mix Packaging Suppose you are the production manager at a food-packaging plant and one of your product lines is trail mix, a healthy snack popular with hikers and backpackers, containing raisins, peanuts and hard-shelled chocolate pieces. By adjusting the mix of these three ingredients, you are able to sell three varieties of this item. The fancy version is sold in half-kilogram packages at outdoor supply stores and has more chocolate and fewer raisins, thus commanding a higher price. The standard version is sold in one kilogram packages in grocery stores and gas station mini-markets. Since the standard version has roughly equal amounts of each ingredient, it is not as expensive as the fancy version. Finally, a bulk version is sold in bins at grocery stores for consumers to load into plastic bags in amounts of their choosing. To appeal to the shoppers that like bulk items for their economy and healthfulness, this mix has many more raisins (at the expense of chocolate) and therefore sells for less. Your production facilities have limited storage space and early each morning you are able to receive and store 380 kilograms of raisins, 500 kilograms of peanuts and 620 kilograms of chocolate pieces. As production manager, one of your most important duties is to decide how much of each version of trail mix to make every day. Clearly, you can have up to 1500 kilograms of raw ingredients available each day, so to be the most productive you will likely produce 1500 kilograms of trail \nSSW I L A B e e z e r : A F i r s t C o u r s e i n L i n e a r A l g e b r a 3 \nmix each day. Also, you would prefer not to have any ingredients leftover each day, so that your final product is as fresh as possible and so that you can receive the maximum delivery the next morning. But how should these ingredients be allocated to the mixing of the bulk, standard and fancy versions? First, we need a little more information about the mixes. Workers mix the ingredients in 15 kilogram batches, and each row of the table below gives a recipe for a 15 kilogram batch. There is some additional information on the costs of the ingredients and the price the manufacturer can charge for the different versions of the trail mix. \n Raisins Peanuts Chocolate Cost Sale Price (kg/batch) (kg/batch) (kg/batch) ($/kg) ($/kg) Bulk 7 6 2 3.69 4.99 Standard 6 4 5 3.86 5.50 Fancy 2 5 8 4.45 6.50 Storage (kg) 380 500 620 Cost ($/kg) 2.55 4.65 4.80 \nAs production manager, it is important to realize that you only have three decisions to make -- the amount of bulk mix to make, the amount of standard mix to make and the amount of fancy mix to make. Everything else is beyond your control or is handled by another department within the company. Principally, you are also limited by the amount of raw ingredients you can store each day. Let us denote the amount of each mix to produce each day, measured in kilograms, by the variable quantities b, s and f. Your production schedule can be described as values of b, s and f that do several things. First, we cannot make negative quantities of each mix, so \nb >= 0 s >= 0 f >= 0 Second, if we want to consume all of our ingredients each day, the storage capacities lead to three (linear) equations, one for each ingredient, \n 7 15 \n b + 6 15 \n s + 2 15 \n f = 380 (raisins) 6 15 \n b + 4 15 \n s + 5 15 \n f = 500 (peanuts) 2 15 \n b + 5 15 \n s + 8 15 \n f = 620 (chocolate) \nIt happens that this system of three equations has just one solution. In other words, as production manager, your job is easy, since there is but one way to use up all of your raw ingredients making trail mix. This single solution is \nb = 300 kg s = 300 kg f = 900 kg. We do not yet have the tools to explain why this solution is the only one, but it should be simple for you to verify that this is indeed a solution. (Go ahead, we will wait.) Determining solutions such as this, and establishing that they are unique, will be the main motivation for our initial study of linear algebra. So we have solved the problem of making sure that we make the best use of our limited storage space, and each day use up all of the raw ingredients that are shipped to us. Additionally, as production manager, you must report weekly to the CEO of the company, and you know he will be more interested in the profit derived from your decisions than in the actual production levels. So you compute, \n 300(4. 99 - 3 .69) + 300(5. 50 - 3 .86) + 900(6. 50 - 4 .45) = 2727. 00 \nfor a daily profit of $2,727 from this production schedule. The computation of the daily profit is also beyond our control, though it is definitely of interest, and it too looks like a \"linear\" computation. \nSSW I L A B e e z e r : A F i r s t C o u r s e i n L i n e a r A l g e b r a 4 \nAs often happens, things do not stay the same for long, and now the marketing department has suggested that your company's trail mix products standardize on every mix being one-third peanuts. Adjusting the peanut portion of each recipe by also adjusting the chocolate portion leads to revised recipes, and slightly different costs for the bulk and standard mixes, as given in the following table. \n Raisins Peanuts Chocolate Cost Sale Price (kg/batch) (kg/batch) (kg/batch) ($/kg) ($/kg) Bulk 7 5 3 3.70 4.99 Standard 6 5 4 3.85 5.50 Fancy 2 5 8 4.45 6.50 Storage (kg) 380 500 620 Cost ($/kg) 2.55 4.65 4.80 In a similar fashion as before, we desire values of b, s and f so that b >= 0 s >= 0 f >= 0 \nand 7 15 \n b + 6 15 \n s + 2 15 \n f = 380 (raisins) 5 15 \n b + 5 15 \n s + 5 15 \n f = 500 (peanuts) 3 15 \n b + 4 15 \n s + 8 15 \n f = 620 (chocolate) \nIt now happens that this system of equations has infinitely many solutions, as we will now demonstrate. Let f remain a variable quantity. Then if we make f kilograms of the fancy mix, we will make 4f - 3300 kilograms of the bulk mix and - 5 f + 4800 kilograms of the standard mix. Let us now verify that, for any choice of f , the values of b = 4f - 3300 and s = - 5 f + 4800 will yield a production schedule that exhausts all of the day's supply of raw ingredients (right now, do not be concerned about how you might derive expressions like these for b and s). Grab your pencil and paper and play along. \n 7 15 (4 \n f - 3300) + 6 15 ( \n - 5 f + 4800) + 2 15 \n f = 0f + 5700 15 \n = 380 5 15 (4 \n f - 3300) + 5 15 ( \n - 5 f + 4800) + 5 15 \n f = 0f + 7500 15 \n = 500 3 15 (4 \n f - 3300) + 4 15 ( \n - 5 f + 4800) + 8 15 \n f = 0f + 9300 15 \n = 620 \nConvince yourself that these expressions for b and s allow us to vary f and obtain an infinite number of possibilities for solutions to the three equations that describe our storage capacities. As a practical matter, there really are not an infinite number of solutions, since we are unlikely to want to end the day with a fractional number of bags of fancy mix, so our allowable values of f should probably be integers. More importantly, we need to remember that we cannot make negative amounts of each mix! Where does this lead us? Positive quantities of the bulk mix requires that \nb >= 0 = 4 f - 3300 >= 0 = f >= 825 Similarly for the standard mix, s >= 0 = - 5 f + 4800 >= 0 = f <= 960 So, as production manager, you really have to choose a value of f from the finite set \n { 825 , 826 ,... , 960 } \nleaving you with 136 choices, each of which will exhaust the day's supply of raw ingredients. Pause now and think about which you would choose. \nSSW I L A B e e z e r : A F i r s t C o u r s e i n L i n e a r A l g e b r a 5 \nRecalling your weekly meeting with the CEO suggests that you might want to choose a production schedule that yields the biggest possible profit for the company. So you compute an expression for the profit based on your as yet undetermined decision for the value of f , \n(4f - 3300)(4. 99 - 3 .70) + (- 5 f + 4800)(5. 50 - 3 .85) + (f )(6. 50 - 4 .45) = - 1. 04 f + 3663 Since f has a negative coefficient it would appear that mixing fancy mix is detrimental to your profit and should be avoided. So you will make the decision to set daily fancy mix production at f = 825. This has the effect of setting b = 4(825) - 3300 = 0 and we stop producing bulk mix entirely. So the remainder of your daily production is standard mix at the level of s = -5(825) + 4800 = 675 kilograms and the resulting daily profit is (- 1 .04)(825) + 3663 = 2805. It is a pleasant surprise that daily profit has risen to $2,805, but this is not the most important part of the story. What is important here is that there are a large number of ways to produce trail mix that use all of the day's worth of raw ingredients and you were able to easily choose the one that netted the largest profit. Notice too how all of the above computations look \"linear.\" In the food industry, things do not stay the same for long, and now the sales department says that increased competition has led to the decision to stay competitive and charge just $5.25 for a kilogram of the standard mix, rather than the previous $5.50 per kilogram. This decision has no effect on the possibilities for the production schedule, but will affect the decision based </passage>"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<tool_call>\\n{\"arguments\": {\"queries\": ['What is your opinion on the use of linear algebra in solving real-world problems?', 'Do you believe that linear algebra is a valuable tool for businesses and industries?

Heavy lines indicate edges that have been (irrevocably) added to the set. \n5.2. TREES 111 \nyou think that the shortest path between any two nodes would land right on this Prim network? Yet if you compare Figure 5.14 with Figure 5.13 you'll see that the quickest way from Bordeaux to Strasbourg is through Marseille, not Vichy. \nSo we end up with the remarkable fact that the shortest route between two points has nothing whatsoever to do with the shortest _total_ distance between _all_ points. Who knew? \n**5.2 Trees** \nA tree is really nothing but a simplification of a graph. There are two kinds of trees in the world: free trees, and rooted trees.^4 \n**Free trees** \nA **free tree** is just a connected graph with no cycles. Every node is reachable from the others, and there's only one way to get anywhere. Take a look at Figure 5.15. It looks just like a graph (and it is) but unlike the WWII France graph, it's more skeletal. This is because in some sense, a free tree doesn't contain anything \"extra.\" \nIf you have a free tree, the following interesting facts are true: \n1. There's exactly one path between any two nodes. (Check it!) \n2. If you remove any edge, the graph becomes disconnected.     (Try it!) \n3. If you add any new edge, you end up adding a cycle. (Try it!) \n4. If there are n nodes, there are n - 1 edges. (Think about it!) \nSo basically, if your goal is connecting all the nodes, and you have a free tree, you're all set. Adding anything is redundant, and taking away anything breaks it. \n(^4) There appears to be no consensus as to which of these concepts is the most basic. Some authors refer to a free tree simply as a \"tree\" -- as though this were the \"normal\" kind of tree -- and use the term rooted tree for the other kind. Other authors do the opposite. To avoid confusion, I'll try to always use the full term (although I admit I'm one who considers rooted trees to be the more important, default concept). \n112 CHAPTER 5. STRUCTURES \n C \n B D \n E \n A \n F \n Figure 5.15: A free tree. \nIf this reminds you of Prim's algorithm, it should. Prim's algorithm produced exactly this: a _free tree_ connecting all the nodes -- and specifically the free tree with shortest possible total length. Go back and look at the final frame of Figure 5.14 and convince yourself that the darkened edges form a free tree. \nFor this reason, the algorithm is often called **Prim's minimal spanning tree algorithm**. A \"spanning tree\" just means \"a free tree that spans (connects) all the graph's nodes.\" \nKeep in mind that there are many free trees one can make with the same set of vertices. For instance, if you remove the edge from A to F, and add one from anything else to F, you have a different free tree. \n**Rooted trees** \nNow a **rooted tree** is the same thing as a free tree, except that we elevate one node to become the **root**. It turns out this makes all the difference. Suppose we chose A as the root of Figure 5.15. Then we would have the rooted tree in the left half of Figure 5.16. The A vertex has been positioned at the top, and everything else is flowing under it. I think of it as reaching into the free tree, carefully grasping a node, and then lifting up your hand so the rest of the free tree dangles from there. Had we chosen (say) C as the root \n5.2. TREES 113 \ninstead, we would have a different rooted tree, depicted in the right half of the figure. Both of these rooted trees have all the same edges as the free tree did: B is connected to both A and C, F is connected only to A, _etc._ The only difference is which node is designated the root. \n A \n F B \n C \n D E \n C \n B \n A \n F \n D E \nFigure 5.16: Two different rooted trees with the same vertices and edges. \nUp to now we've said that the spatial positioning on graphs is irrelevant. But this changes a bit with rooted trees. Vertical positioning is our only way of showing which nodes are \"above\" others, and the word \"above\" does indeed have meaning here: it means closer to the root. The altitude of a node shows how many steps it is away from the root. In the right rooted tree, nodes B, D, and E are all one step away from the root (C), while node F is three steps away. \nThe key aspect to rooted trees -- which is both their greatest advantage and greatest limitation -- is that _every node has one and only one path to the root._ This behavior is inherited from free trees: as we noted, every node has only one path to every other. \nTrees have a myriad of applications. Think of the files and folders on your hard drive: at the top is the root of the filesystem (perhaps \"/\" on Linux/Mac or \"C:\\\\\" on Windows) and underneath that are named folders. Each folder can contain files as well as other named folders, and so on down the hierarchy. The result is that each file has one, and only one, distinct path to it from the top of the filesystem. The file can be stored, and later retrieved, in exactly one way. \n114 CHAPTER 5. STRUCTURES \nAn \"org chart\" is like this: the CEO is at the top, then underneath her are the VP's, the Directors, the Managers, and finally the rankand-file employees. So is a military organization: the Commander in Chief directs generals, who command colonels, who command majors, who command captains, who command lieutenants, who command sergeants, who command privates. \nThe human body is even a rooted tree of sorts: it contains skeletal, cardiovascular, digestive, and other systems, each of which is comprised of organs, then tissues, then cells, molecules, and atoms. In fact, anything that has this sort of part-whole containment hierarchy is just asking to be represented as a tree. \nIn computer programming, the applications are too numerous to name. Compilers scan code and build a \"parse tree\" of its underlying meaning. HTML is a way of structuring plain text into a tree-like hierarchy of displayable elements. AI chess programs build trees representing their possible future moves and their opponent's probable responses, in order to \"see many moves ahead\" and evaluate their best options. Object-oriented designs involve \"inheritance hierarchies\" of classes, each one specialized from a specific other. _Etc._ Other than a simple sequence (like an array), trees are probably the most common data structure in all of computer science. \n**Rooted tree terminology** \nRooted trees carry with them a number of terms. I'll use the tree on the left side of Figure 5.16 as an illustration of each: \n**root.** The node at the top of the tree, which is A in our example. Note that unlike trees in the real world, computer science trees have their root at the top and grow down. Every tree has a root except the **empty tree** , which is the \"tree\" that has no nodes at all in it.

Very specific, higher stakes, more complex answers As you hone your path of inquiry, you may need to zoom in or out in terms of scope: depending on your rhetorical situation, you will need different degrees of focus. Just like narration, research writing benefits from a careful consideration of scope. Often, a narrower scope is easier to work with than a broader scope--you will be able to write more and write better if your question asks for more complex thinking. It's important to be flexible throughout your research project. Be prepared to pivot topics, adjust your research question, change your opinions, and confront unanticipated challenges. As you build a working knowledge of your topic, you might complicate or narrow your working questions. Gradually, try to articulate a research question (or combination of questions). Remember to be flexible as you research though: you might need to pivot, adjust, refocus, or replace your research question as you learn more. Consider this imaginary case study as an example of this process: Ahmed began his project by identifying the following areas of interest: racism in the US, technology in medicine and health care, and independent filmmaking. After doing some freewriting and preliminary research on each, he decided he wanted to learn more about racially motivated police violence. He developed working questions: \n#### WORKING QUESTIONS \n A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 146 \n Are police officers likely to make judgments about citizens based on their race?  Have police forces instituted policies to avoid racism?  Who is most vulnerable to police violence?  Why does it seem like police officers target people of color? Who is responsible for overseeing the police? He realized that he needed to narrow his focus to develop a more viable path of inquiry, eventually ending up with the following research question:  Over the last thirty years, what populations are most likely to experience police violence in the US? However, after completing more research, Ahmed discovered that his answers came pretty readily: young Black men are significantly more vulnerable to be victims of police violence. He realized that he was not really saying anything new, so he had to tweak his path of inquiry. Ahmed did some more freewriting and dug around to find a source that disagreed with him or added a new layer to his answers. He discovered eventually that there are a handful of police organizations that have made genuine efforts to confront racism in their practices. Despite the widespread and normalized violence enacted against people of color, these groups were working against racial violence. He reoriented his research question to be the following:  Have antiracist police trainings and strategies been effective in reducing individual or institutional racism over the last thirty years?

How did you find     more information about it? What was the last thing that pulled you down     an internet rabbit hole? \n**2.** How would you adapt the following question so that it leads to further     inquiry and analysis rather than the straightforward reporting of facts?     \"How can the average consumer reduce their carbon emissions?\" \n#### DISCUSSION QUESTIONS \n A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 148 \n**1.** Brainstorming. Create a catalog of topics you are personally curious     about--things that you want to learn more about. These don't have to be     revolutionary things right away; it's more important that they're     meaningful to you.        **a.** First, choose three of the following broad topic           headings: politics, science and technology, food, sports,           music and art, other cultures and nations, social justice,           the environment and sustainability, health and disease,           business and economy, education. On your first sheet           of a three-column paper, write those three topic           headings. **b.** Next, underneath each topic heading, write bulleted lists of as many subtopics or related ideas that come to mind that interest you. (Try not to censor yourself here--the idea is to generate a large number of bullet points. To some extent, this is an exercise in free association: What are the first things that come to mind when you think of each topic?) Spend ten to fifteen minutes on your lists.        **c.** Read over your lists, making note especially of items           that surprised you. Choose the three items from the           full page that most interest you. You can choose one           from each column, three from the same, or any           combination of lists, so long as you have three items           that you care about. \n**2.** Idea generation: Internet stumbling.

Through the magic of hyperlinks and social media,     random chance can set us in the right direction to develop a research topic.        Spend fifteen to twenty minutes clicking around on the internet,        using one of the following media for guidance, and jot down every        potential topic that piques your interest.           **a.** Wikipedia: Go to the Wikipedia homepage and check              out the \"featured article\" of the day, or choose              \"Random Article\" from the sidebar on the far left. Click \n#### ACTIVITIES \n149 COLLECTED WORKS \n any of the hyperlinks in the article to redirect to a different page. Bounce from article to article, keeping track of the titles of pages and sections that catch your eye. b. An Instagram, Facebook, Reddit, or Twitter feed: Flow through one or more social media feeds, using links, geotags, user handles, and hashtags to encounter a variety of posts. c. After stumbling, review the list you've made of potentially interesting topics. Are you already familiar with any of them? Which surprised you? Are there any relationships or intersections worth exploring further? From these topics and subtopics, try to articulate a viable and interesting research question that speaks to your curiosity. \n**3.** Moving from topics to questions: Small group activity. Begin to develop     working and research questions by collaborating with your classmates to     explore different curiosities.        **a.** Divide your paper into three columns. Write three           potential topics as headings, one in each column. **b.** Sit in a circle with your groupmates; each student should pass their three-column paper one position clockwise. For five minutes, each student will freewrite questions about each topic. No question is too big or small, too simple or complex. Try to generate as many questions as you possibly can. Then rotate your papers another step--repeat until you have your original sheet of paper back.        **c.** Review the questions your groupmates compiled on           your sheet. Have they offered anything that surprises           you--issues you haven't thought of, relationships           between questions, recurring themes or patterns of           interest, or foci that might yield interesting answers? \n**4.** Moving from topics to questions: Whole class gallery walk. Begin to     develop working and research questions by collaborating with your     classmates to explore different curiosities.        A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 150 \n a. Write your three favorite topic ideas in the headings of a three-column paper. Every student should tape their papers to the classroom wall, just below eye level, so that it forms a circular shape around the perimeter of the room. b. Each student in the class should stand in front of their paper, then rotate one position clockwise. c. At each new page, you will have two minutes to review the headings and freewrite questions about each topic. No question is too big or small, too simple or complex. Try to generate as many questions as you possibly can. Then rotate through clockwise until you've returned to your original position. d. Review the questions your classmates compiled on your sheet. Have they offered anything that surprises you--issues you haven't thought of, relationships between questions, recurring themes or patterns of interest, or foci that might yield interesting answers? \n**5.** Focus and scope.

Such consternation! Educators are fond of research papers because they require you to find your own sources, confront conflicting evidence, and synthesize diverse information and ideas--all skills required in any professional leadership role. Research papers also allow students to pursue their own topic of interest; your professors have to assume that you are genuinely interested in at least some major part of the course. The open-endedness of research papers sets you up to do your best work as a self-motivated scholar. This chapter is about secondary sources: what they are, where to find them, and how to choose them. For example, let's think about the distinction between primary and secondary sources. Primary sources are original documents, data, or images: the law code of the Le Dynasty in Vietnam, the letters of Kurt Vonnegut, data gathered from an experiment on color perception, an interview, or Farm Service Administration photographs from the 1930s. Secondary sources are produced by analyzing primary sources. They include news articles, scholarly articles, reviews of films or art exhibitions, documentary films, and other pieces that have some descriptive or analytical purpose. Some things may be primary sources in one context but secondary sources in another. For example, if you're using news articles to inform an analysis of a historical event, they're serving as secondary sources. If you're counting the number of times a particular newspaper reported on different types of events, then the news articles are serving as primary sources because they're more akin to raw data. You've probably heard by now that if you cite Wikipedia as an authoritative source, the wrath of your instructor shall be visited upon you. Why is it that even the most informative Wikipedia articles are still often considered illegitimate? And what are good sources to use? The table below summarizes the types of secondary sources in four tiers. All sources have their legitimate uses, but the top-tier ones are preferable for citation in an academic context. \n#### AH, THE RESEARCH PAPER \n#### SOME SOURCES ARE BETTER THAN OTHERS \n A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 154 \n Table 20.1 Analyzing the quality of secondary sources \n##### Tier Type Content Uses How to find them \n##### Tier \n##### I \n Peer-reviewed academic publications Rigorous research and analysis Provide strong evidence for claims and references to other high-quality sources Google Scholar, library catalogs, and academic article databases \n##### Tier \n##### II \n Reports, articles, and books from credible nonacademic sources Well-researched and even-handed descriptions of an event or state of the world Initial research on events or trends not yet analyzed in the academic literature; may reference important Tier 1 sources Websites of relevant agencies, Google searches using *.gov or *.org sites, academic article databases \n##### Tier \n##### III \n Short pieces from newspapers or credible websites Simple reporting of events, research findings, or policy changes Often point to useful Tier 2 or Tier 1 sources; may provide a factoid or two not found anywhere else Strategic Google searches or article databases, including newspapers and magazines \n##### Tier \n##### IV \n Agenda-driven or uncertain pieces Mostly opinion, varying in thoughtfulness and credibility May represent a particular position within a debate; more often provide keywords and clues about higher-quality sources Nonspecific Google </passage>"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<tool_call>\\n{\"arguments\": {\"queries\": ['Do you think religion plays a significant role in Middle Eastern politics?', 'In your opinion, what is the most effective way to reduce individual or institutional racism?', 'Should marijuana sales be organized by the government?'], \"name\": \"ExpertQAExtractor\"}}\\n</tool_call>"}]}

Needless to say, the domain and the codomain must have the     same cardinality for this to be possible. \n50 CHAPTER 3. RELATIONS \n The function employeeNumber -- with employees as the domain and employee numbers as the codomain -- is a bijective function. Every employee has an employee number, and every employee number goes with exactly one employee. As a corollary of this, there are the same number of employees as employee numbers. \nFinally, a few extensionally-defined examples. With X = { Harry, Ron, Hermione } and Y = { Dr. Pepper, Mt. Dew }, consider the function f 1 : \n f 1 (Harry) = Mt. Dew f 1 (Ron) = Mt. Dew f 1 (Hermione) = Mt. Dew \nIs f 1 injective? **No** , since more than one wizard (all of them, in fact) map to Mt. Dew. Is it surjective? **No** , since _no_ wizard maps to Dr. Pepper. Is it bijective? **No** , duh, since to be bijective it must be both injective and surjective. \nNow for f 2 , change Ron to map to Dr. Pepper instead: \n f 2 (Harry) = Mt. Dew f 2 (Ron) = Dr. Pepper f 2 (Hermione) = Mt. Dew \nIs f 2 injective? Still **no** , since more than one wizard maps to Mt. Dew. (And of course _no_ function between these two sets can be injective, since there aren't enough soft drinks for each wizard to have his/her own.) But is it surjective? **Yes** , it is now surjective, since _every_ soft drink has at least one wizard mapping to it. (Still not bijective for obvious reasons.) \nNow let's add Pepsi and Barqs Root Beer to our set of soft drinks Y , so that it now has four elements: { Dr. Pepper, Mt. Dew, Pepsi, Barqs Root Beer }. Consider the function f 3 : \n3.7. PROPERTIES OF FUNCTIONS 51 \n f 3 (Harry) = Pepsi f 3 (Ron) = Pepsi f 3 (Hermione) = Mt. Dew \nIs f 3 injective? **No** , since more than one wizard maps to Pepsi. Is it surjective? **No** , since _no_ wizard maps to Dr. Pepper or Barqs. (And of course _no_ function between these two sets can be surjective, since there aren't enough wizards for each drink to have one.) And of course not bijective. \nNow for f 4 , change Ron to map to Dr. Pepper instead: \n f 4 (Harry) = Pepsi f 4 (Ron) = Dr. Pepper f 4 (Hermione) = Mt. Dew \nStill not surjective, of course, but now it _is_ injective, since no drink has more than one wizard. (Still of course not bijective.) \nFinally, let's add one more wizard (Neville) to the mix for two more examples. Let f 5 be: \n f 5 (Harry) = Barqs Root Beer f 5 (Ron) = Dr. Pepper f 5 (Hermione) = Mt. Dew f 5 (Neville) = Dr. Pepper \nIs f 5 injective? **No** , since Dr. Pepper has two wizards. Is it surjective? **No** , since Pepsi has none. Struck out on all counts. However, one small change and everything falls into place: \n f 6 (Harry) = Barqs Root Beer f 6 (Ron) = Pepsi f 6 (Hermione) = Mt. Dew f 6 (Neville) = Dr. Pepper \nIs this last function injective, surjective, bijective? **Yes** to all three! Every wizard gets his/her own soft drink, every soft drink gets its \n52 CHAPTER 3. RELATIONS \nown wizard, and no soft drinks (or wizards) are left out. How exciting. This is a perfectly bijective function, also called a **bijection**. Again, the only way to get a bijection is for the domain and codomain to be the same size (although that alone does not _guarantee_ a bijection; witness f 5 , above). Also observe that if they _are_ the same size, then injectivity and surjectivity go hand-in-hand. Violate one, and you're bound to violate the other. Uphold the one, and you're bound to uphold the other. There's a nice, pleasing, symmetrical elegance to the whole idea. \n 3.8. EXERCISES 53 \n**3.8 Exercises** \n1. Let A be the set { Chuck,     Julie, Sam } and S be the set     { basketball, volleyball }.     Is { (Julie, basketball), (Sam,     basketball), (Julie, volley-     ball) } a relation between A     and S? \n Yes it is, since it is a subset of A x S. \n2. Is the above relation an en-     dorelation? \n No, because an endorelation involves one set with itself, not two different sets (like A and S are.) \n3. Is { (Chuck, basketball),     (basketball, volleyball) } a re-     lation between A and S? \n No, since the first element of one of the ordered pairs is not from the set A. \n4. Is  a relation between A and     S? \n Yes it is, since it is a subset of A x S. \n5. How large could a relation be-     tween A and S be? \n The maximum cardinality is 6, if all three athletes played all three sports. (I'm assuming that the meaning of the relation is \"plays\" instead of \"isAFanOf \" or \"knowsTheRulesFor\" or something else. In any case, the maximum cardinality is 6.) \n6. Let T be the set { Spock,     Kirk, McCoy, Scotty,     Uhura }. Let O be an     endorelation on T , defined     as follows: { (Kirk, Scotty),     (Spock, Scotty), (Kirk,     Spock), (Scotty, Spock) }. \n Is T reflexive? \n No, since it doesn't have any of the elements of T appearing with themselves. \n 54 CHAPTER 3. RELATIONS \n7. Is T symmetric? \n No, since it contains (Kirk, Scotty) but not (Scotty, Kirk). \n8. Is T antisymmetric? \n No, since it contains (Spock, Scotty) and also (Scotty, Spock). \n9. Is T transitive? \n Yes, since for every (x, y) and (y, z) present, the corresponding (x, z) is also present. (The only example that fits this is x=Kirk, y=Spock, z=Scotty, and the required ordered pair is indeed present.) \n10. Let H be an endorelation     on T , defined as follows:     { (Kirk, Kirk), (Spock,     Spock), (Uhura, Scotty),     (Scotty, Uhura), (Spock,     McCoy), (McCoy, Spock),     (Scotty, Scotty), (Uhura,     Uhura) }.     Is H reflexive? No, since it's missing (McCoy, Mc-Coy). \n11. Is H symmetric? \n Yes, since for every (x, y) it contains, the corresponding (y, x) is also present. \n12. Is H antisymmetric? \n No, since it contains (Uhura, Scotty) and also (Scotty, Uhura). \n13. Is H transitive? \n Yes, since there aren't any examples of (x, y) and (y, z) pairs both being present. \n14. Let outranks be an endore-     lation on the set of all crew     members of the Enterprise,     where (x, y)  outranks if     character x has a higher Star     Fleet rank than y.     Is outranks reflexive? No,him/herself.^ since^ no^ officer^ outranks \n 3.8. EXERCISES 55 \n15. Is outranks symmetric? \n No, since an officer cannot outrank an officer who in turn outranks him/her. \n16. Is outranks antisymmetric? \n Yes, since if one officer outranks a second, the second one cannot also outrank the first. \n17. Is outranks transitive? \n Yes, since if one officer outranks a second, and that officer outranks a third, the first obviously also outranks the third. \n18. Is outranks a partial order? \n No, but close. It satisfies antisymmetry and transitivity, which are crucial. The only thing it doesn't satisfy is reflexivity, since none of the members appear with themselves. If we changed this relation to ranksAtLeastAsHighAs, then we could include these \"double\" pairs and have ourselves a partial order. \n19. Let sameShirtColor be an     endorelation on the set of     all crew members of the     Enterprise, where (x, y)      sameShirtColor if character     x ordinarily wears the same     shirt color as character y. \n Is sameShirtColor reflexive? \n Yes, since you can't but help wear the same shirt color as you're wearing. \n20. Is sameShirtColor symmet-     ric? \n Yes, since if a crew member wears the same shirt color as another, then that second crew member also wears the same shirt color as the first. If Scotty and Uhura both wear red, then Uhura and Scotty both wear red, duh. \n21. Is sameShirtColor antisym-     metric? \n No, for probably obvious reasons. \n 56 CHAPTER 3. RELATIONS \n22. Is sameShirtColor transitive? \n Yes. If Kirk and Sulu wear the same color (yellow), and Sulu and Chekov wear the same color (yellow), then Kirk and Chekov most certainly will wear the same color (yellow). \n23. Above, we defined A as the     set { Chuck, Julie, Sam } and     S as the set { basketball, vol-     leyball }. Then we defined     the relation { (Julie, bas-     ketball), (Sam, basketball),     (Julie, volleyball) }.     Is this relation a function? No, because it's missing Chuck en-tirely. \n24. Suppose we added the or-     dered pair (Chuck, basket-     ball) to it. Now is it a func-     tion? \n No, because Julie appears twice, mapping to two different values. \n25. Okay. Suppose we then re-     move (Julie, volleyball). We     now have { (Julie, bas-     ketball), (Sam, basketball),     (Chuck, basketball) }. Is _this_     a function? \n Yes. Congratulations. \n26. Let's call this function     \"faveSport,\" which suggests     that its meaning is to in-     dicate which sport is each     athlete's favorite. What's     the domain of faveSport? \n { Julie, Chuck, Sam }. \n27. What's the codomain of     faveSport? \n { basketball, volleyball }. \n28. What's the range of faveS-     port? \n { basketball }. \n 3.8. EXERCISES 57 \n29. Is faveSport injective? \n No, because Julie and Sam (and Chuck) all map to the same value (basketball). For a function to be injective, there must be no two domain elements that map to the same codomain element. \n30. Is there any way to make it     injective? \n Not without altering the underlying sets. There are three athletes and two sports, so we can't help but map multiple athletes to the same sport. \n31. Fine. Is faveSport surjective? \n No, because no one maps to volleyball. \n32. Is there any way to make it     surjective? \n Sure, for instance change Sam from basketball to volleyball. Now both of the codomain elements are \"reachable\" by some domain element, so it's surjective. \n33. Is faveSport now also bijec-     tive? \n No, because it's still not injective. \n34. How can we alter things so     that it's bijective? \n One way is to add a third sport -- say, kickboxing -- and move either Julie or Chuck over to kickboxing. If we have Julie map to kickboxing, Sam map to volleyball, and Chuck map to basketball, we have a bijection. \n35. How do we normally write     the fact that \"Julie maps to     kickboxing\"? \n faveSport(Julie) = kickboxing. \n36. What's another name for \"in-     jective?\" \n one-to-one. \n37. What's another name for     \"surjective?\" \n onto. \n38. What's another name for     \"range?\" \n image. \n### Chapter 4 \n## Probability \nProbability is the study of _uncertainty_. This may seem like a hopeless endeavor, sort of like knowing the unknowable, but it's not.

(Step 1) Now compute 1838 mod 16. This gives us the value     14, which is of course a base 10 number. The equivalent hex     digit is E. So we now write down E to the left of the 3: \nE3 \n4. (Step 2) Dividing 1838 by 16 and taking the floor gives us \n114. Since this is again not zero, we perform step 2b: make 114 our new value, move our pencil to the left of the E, and go back to step 1. \n5. (Step 1) Next we compute 114 mod 16. This turns out to be     2, so we write down a 2: \n2E3 \n176 CHAPTER 7. NUMBERS \n6. (Step 2) Computing  114 / 16  produces 7, which is again not     zero, so 7 becomes our new value and we go back once again     to step 2b. \n7. (Step 1) 7 mod 16 is simply 7, so we write it down: \n72E3 \n8. (Step 2) Finally,  7 / 16  is zero, so we go to step 2a and     we're done. The page has 72E3 written on it in big bold     letters, which is the correct answer. \n**Adding hex numbers** \nSuppose we have two hexadecimal numbers, and we want to add them together to get a hexadecimal result. How do we do it? One way is to first convert them both to decimal, then add them like you learned in first grade, then convert the answer back to hex. But we can stay \"natively hex\" as long as we add each pair of digits correctly. \nLet's try it. Suppose we want to compute this sum: \n48 D (^416) +59 2 5 16 ? 16 We proceed in the first-grade way from right to left. Adding the one's-place values, we get 4 + 5 = 9: 48 D (^416) +59 2 5 16 (^916) Easy enough. Now we add the next digit to the left (the sixteen'splace, mind you, not the ten's place) and we find D + 2. Now what in the world is \"D+2\"? It's actually easy: all you have to do is the same thing you did when you were a child and you had to add something like 4 + 5. You hadn't memorized the answer \n7.4. BINARY (BASE 2) 177 \nyet, and so you started with four fingers held up, and counted off \"1... 2... 3... 4... 5,\" sticking up another finger each time. Then, you looked at your hands, and behold! nine fingers. \nWe'll do the same thing here: start with the number \"D,\" and count two additional places: \"E... F.\" The answer is F. That is the number that's two greater than D. Lucky for us, it still fits in one digit. So now we have: \n48 D (^416) +59 2 5 16 F (^916) So far so good. The next pair of digits is 8 + 9. Here's where you want to be careful. You're liable to look at \"8+9\" and immediately say \"17!\" But 8 + 9 is _not_ 17 in hexadecimal. To figure out what it is, we start with the number 8, and count: \"9... A... B... C... D... E... F... 10... 11... \". The answer is \"11,\" which of course is how you write \"seventeen\" in hex. So just like in grade school, we write down 1 and carry the 1: 1 48 D (^416) +59 2 5 16 1 F (^916) Finally, our last digit is 4 + 5, plus the carried 1. We start with four and count off five: \"5... 6... 7... 8... 9.\" Then we add the carry, and count \"... A.\" The answer is A, with no carry, and so we have our final answer: 1 4 8D (^416) + 5 9 2 5 16 **A1F9 16 7.4 Binary (base 2)** The other base we commonly use in computer science is base 2, or **binary**. This is because the basic unit of information in a computer is called a **bit** , which has only two values, conventionally called either \"true\" and \"false\" or \"1\" and \"0\". Numbers (as well \n178 CHAPTER 7. NUMBERS \nas everything else) are ultimately represented as colossal sequences of 1's and 0's, which are of course binary numbers. \nThe rules for interpreting place value are the same: \n 1101012 = 1 x 25 + 1 x 24 + 0 x 23 + 1 x 22 + 0 x 21 + 1 x 20 = 1 x 32 + 1 x 16 + 0 x 8 + 1 x 4 + 0 x 2 + 1 x 1 = 5310. \nSo in binary we have a one's-place, a two's-place, a four's-place, an eight's-place, and so on. We call the right-most place the **least significant bit (LSB)** and the left-most the **most significant bit (MSB)**. \nCounting up from zero is really just the same as any other base, although it feels a little strange in binary because you \"roll over\" so often: \n 02 zero 12 one 102 two 112 three 1002 four 1012 five 1102 six 1112 seven 10002 eight 10012 nine .. . \n .. . \n**Converting to and from decimal** \nConverting from binary to decimal was demonstrated above (with 1101012 = 53 10 .) To go the other way, we follow the algorithm from page 174. Let's try it for the decimal number 49: \n1. (Step 1) We first compute 49 mod 2. Doing \"mod 2\" is easy:     you just see whether the number is even or odd. In this case,     it's odd, so the remainder is a 1: \n7.4. BINARY (BASE 2) 179 \n1 \n2. (Step 2) Now divide 49 by 2 and take the floor, which gives      49 / 2  = 24. It's not zero, so we perform step 2b: make 24     our new value, move our pencil to the left of the 1, and go     back to step 1. \n3. (Step 1) Compute 24 mod 2. Since 24 is even, this is zero,     which we write down to the left of the 1: \n01 \n4. (Step 2) Divide 24 by 2 and take the floor, which gives  24 /     2  = 12. Make 12 our new value, move our pencil to the left     of the 0, and go back to step 1. \n5. (Step 1) Compute 12 mod 2. Since 12 is even, this is zero,     which we write down: \n001 \n6. (Step 2) Divide 12 by 2 and take the floor, which gives  12 /     2  = 6. Make 6 our new value, move our pencil to the left of     the 0, and go back to step 1. \n7. (Step 1) Compute 6 mod 2. Since 6 is even, this is zero, which     we write down: \n0001 \n8. (Step 2) Divide 6 by 2 and take the floor, which gives  6 / 2  =     3. Make 3 our new value, move our pencil to the left of the     0, and go back to step 1. \n9. (Step 1) Compute 3 mod 2. Since 3 is odd, this is one, which     we write down: \n180 CHAPTER 7. NUMBERS \n10001 \n10. (Step 2) Divide 3 by 2 and take the floor, which gives  3 / 2  =     1. This still isn't zero, so make 1 our new value, move our     pencil to the left of the 0, and go back to step 1. \n11. (Step 1) Compute 1 mod 2. Since 1 is odd, this is one, which     we write down: \n110001 \n12. (Step 2) Divide 1 by 2 and take the floor, which gives  1 / 2  =     0. We're done. The final answer is 1100012. Double-checking     our work, we verify that indeed one 32 plus one 16 plus one     1 gives 49, which is what we started with. \n**Converting to and from hex** \nThat was pretty tedious. But converting back and forth from binary to _hex_ is a snap. That's because 16 is exactly 24 , and so one hex digit is exactly equal to four binary digits. This isn't the case with base 10, where one decimal digit is equal to three binary digits... _plus_ a little extra. This \"not quite a whole number of digits\" thing is what makes converting from decimal to binary (or decimal to hex, for that matter) so awkward. \nWe most commonly deal with sets of eight bits at a time, which is called a **byte**. (This is the fundamental unit of storage on pretty much every computer on earth.) Suppose I had the following byte: \n(^100001102) Because one hex digit is exactly equal to four bits, this byte is exactly equal to: (^8616) \n7.4. BINARY (BASE 2) 181 \nThis is because the byte can be neatly split into two parts: 1000 , which corresponds to the hex digit 8, and 0110, which corresponds to the hex digit 6. These two halves are called **nibbles** -- one byte has two nibbles, and each nibble is one hex digit. At a glance, therefore, with no multiplying or adding, we can convert from binary to hex. \nGoing the other direction is just as easy. If we have: \n 3E 16 \nwe just convert each hex digit into the corresponding nibble: \n(^001111102) After you do this a while, you get to the point where you can instantly recognize which hex digit goes with which nibble value. Until then, though, here's a handy table: nibble hex digit 0000 0 0001 1 0010 2 0011 3 0100 4 0101 5 0110 6 0111 7 1000 8 1001 9 1010 A 1011 B 1100 C 1101 D 1110 E 1111 F In case you're wondering, yes this is worth memorizing. \n182 CHAPTER 7. NUMBERS \n**Adding binary numbers** \nAdding two binary numbers is the same as adding in decimal, hexadecimal, or any other base: you just have to know when to \"roll over the odometer,\" which in this case is almost instantly, since the highest value a bit can hold is 1! Let's give it a shot: \n(^1110012) + (^0110102) ? 2 A child could follow the rules: when we add two zeroes, we get zero. Adding a one to a zero gives one. Adding two ones gives zero, and a carry to the next significant digit. And adding two ones plus a carry gives a one and a carry. See if you can follow the flow: 1 1 (^1110012) + (^0110102) 1 010011 2 **Capacity** How large a value can a byte store? There are 8 bits, and each one can independently have either of two values (0 or 1), so by the Fundamental Theorem of Counting, there are 28 different combinations. This works out to 256, but we can't actually store the number 256 in a byte if we're using the bit pattern 000000002 (or 0016 ) to represent zero. The highest value would be 111111112 (or FF 16 ), which is 25610. How do we store a number larger than that? Simply use more than one byte, of course. If we used two bytes of memory, and treated them as concatenated one after the other, that would give us 16 bits, allowing us to store up to the number 00000000000000002 = FFFF 16 = 65,535 10. We'd call one of these bytes -- the one representing the 20 's place up to the 27 's place -- the least significant _byte_ , and the other one -- containing places 28 through 215 -- the most significant byte. Extending to more than two bytes to accommodate even larger numbers is done in the obvious way. \n7.4. BINARY (BASE 2) 183 \n**Binary representation schemes** \nThat's mostly all there is to it.

Extending to more than two bytes to accommodate even larger numbers is done in the obvious way. \n7.4. BINARY (BASE 2) 183 \n**Binary representation schemes** \nThat's mostly all there is to it. But there's one thing we haven't discussed yet, and that's _negative_ numbers. We know how to represent any positive number (or zero) with an ordinary place value scheme. But how do we store a number like - 5? \nThere are three different schemes for treating negative numbers, each with its strengths and weaknesses. \n**Unsigned** \nThe simplest scheme is called **unsigned** , and it simply means that we don't _allow_ negative numbers. For one byte, we have 256 different bit patterns at our disposal, and we might just choose to allocate them all to represent positive numbers, so as to get the widest range. This makes sense for, say, a C++ program variable called heightInInches which we know can never meaningfully be negative (no one has a negative height). \nThe advantage of this scheme is simply that we can represent the greatest possible range of positive numbers, which is sometimes the goal. Each of the alternative schemes carves off a chunk of these available bit patterns and devotes them to representing negative numbers, leaving fewer left over for positive numbers. There's no free lunch: you have to decide how you want to \"spend\" your available bit patterns depending on what values you need to represent. \n**Sign-magnitude** \nThe **sign-magnitude** scheme is probably the first thing you'd think of to solve the negative number representation problem. We need to store the sign of the number somehow, and a sign is inherently a two-valued thing (either positive or negative), so why not peel off one of the bits and use it to represent the sign? The remaining bits can then be used in the ordinary way to represent the magnitude of the number. \nThe way this is most often done is to take the left-most bit and use it as the **sign bit**. This bit now has _no other meaning_. It \n184 CHAPTER 7. NUMBERS \ncan't \"double\" as the 128's place, because then there'd be no way to distinguish between, say, 129 and - 129 (each would be represented with 10000001 .) No, the sign bit must be considered \"spent money,\" and its expressive power cannot be reclaimed to also represent part of the magnitude. By convention, if the sign bit is 0 this represents a _positive_ number, and a sign bit of 1 represents a _negative_ number. (That might seem counterintuitive, but hey, that's the way it is.) \nSo this number in sign-magnitude: \n 0 0100110 \nrepresents the decimal number 38. That's because the sign bit (bolded, on the far left) is 0, which means the number is positive. The magnitude of the number is contained in the other 7 bits, which gives 32 + 4 + 2 = 38. This number, on the other hand: \n 1 0100110 \nrepresents - 38. The magnitude is the same, but the sign bit is 1 so this pattern now \"means\" a negative number. \nClearly we have reduced our range of positive numbers in exchange for the ability to also store negatives. We have 7 bits of range instead of 8, so instead of 255, our highest possible value is merely \n127. On the other end, the lowest possible value is - 127. \nIf you have sharp eyes, you may have noticed a discrepancy in the counting. With the sign-magnitude approach, we can hold numbers in the range - 127 to 127. But wait: that's only 255 different values, not 256! Why did we lose one value of expressive power? The answer is that the sign-magnitude scheme has _two ways_ of representing _zero_. The bit pattern 00000000 is obviously zero, but so is 10000000 (which you might call \"negative zero.\") Using two different patterns to represent the same value is a little wasteful, but the situation is actually worse than that. Having to account for both patterns means that computer hardware using the signmagnitude scheme is inevitably more complicated. To compare two \n7.4. BINARY (BASE 2) 185 \nbytes to see if they're equal, you'd think we'd just compare each bit position, and if they were all the same, the bytes would be declared equal, otherwise no. Alas, this is no longer quite that simple. The two zero patterns must be considered numerically equal, so our digital logic now has to contain a special case. \"To be equal, all the bits have to be the same... oh, but actually not if the right-most seven are all zeroes in both bytes. In that case, it doesn't matter what the left-most bit contains.\" Maddening. \n**Two's-complement** \nThis shortcoming in the sign-magnitude scheme is remedied with the **two's-complement** scheme, which is the one actually used most often in practice. It'll seem weird at first -- certainly not as intuitive as the first two -- but it leads to a critically important feature that we'll look at shortly. \nFirst, the rules. To interpret a two's-complement number, you: \n1. Look at the left-most bit (just like in sign-magnitude). If     it's a 0, you have a positive number. If it's a 1, you have a     negative number. \n2. If it's a positive number, the other 7 bits give you the mag-     nitude (just like in sign-magnitude). \n3. If, however, it's a negative number, then to discover the mag-     nitude of that negative number you must _flip all the bits and_     _add one_. This will give you a positive number which is the     absolute value of your negative number. \nEasy example: take the byte 00100110. The left-most bit is a 0, which means it's a positive number, and as we discovered above, the remaining 7 bits give a magnitude of 38. So this is the number 38. \nHarder example: take the byte 10100110. The left-most bit is a 1, which means it's negative. Okay: negative _what_? How do we find the magnitude? Well, we \"flip\" all the bits ( _i.e._ , invert each one \n186 CHAPTER 7. NUMBERS \nfrom 0 to 1 or vice versa) to get: \n 01011001 \nand then add one to the result: \n 1 01011001 + 1 01011010 \nThis black magic produces the value 010110102 , which converts to 9010. **This means that the original number, 10100110 , corresponds to the value -90.** \n\"Flipping all the bits and adding one\" is the cookbook procedure for taking the complement (negative) of a number in the two'scomplement scheme. It works in reverse, too. Let's start with 90 this time and crank through the process again, making sure we get -90. \nStart with the binary representation of 9010 : \n 01011010 \nFlip all the bits to get: 10100101 \nand finally add one to the result: \n 1 10100101 + 1 10100110 \nWe get 10100110 , which was precisely the number we originally began with, and which we have already determined represents -90. \nNow you may ask what we gain from all this. Surely this scheme is considerably more convoluted than the simple idea of reserving one bit as a sign bit, and treating the rest as a magnitude. But it turns out there is indeed a method to the madness. Strange as \n7.4. BINARY (BASE 2) 187 \nit sounds, a two's-complement representation scheme allows us to _perform addition and subtraction with a single operation._ \nIn first grade (or so), you learned the procedure for adding multidigit numbers, which we've followed several times in this chapter. It involves adding the digits right-to-left and possibly \"carrying.\" Then in second grade (or so), you learned the procedure for _subtracting_ multi-digit numbers. It involves subtracting the digits right-to-left and possibly \"borrowing.\" If you're like me, you found adding easier than subtracting. It's easy to just carry the one, but to borrow requires looking at the digit to the left, making sure that you _can_ borrow from it ( _i.e._ , that it's not already 0), borrowing from further left until you actually find an available non-zero value, hoping the number on the bottom is actually less than the one on the top (because otherwise you have to switch the order and then add a negative sign to the result), and keeping all of that straight as you march down the line. \nEven if you didn't find subtracting more difficult than adding, though, you can't argue that it's still a completely _different_ algorithm, with different rules to follow. In computer hardware, we have to implement different circuitry to perform each operation, which is more difficult, costly, error-prone, and power-draining. \nThe wonderful thing about two's-complement, however, is that with this scheme we actually _never need to use the subtraction algorithm._ If we want to subtract two numbers -- say, 24 - 37 -- we can instead take the complement of the second number and then add them. Instead of 24 - 37 we compute 24 + (-37). \nLet's see it in action. Using conversion procedures, we can figure out that 2410 is: \n 00011000 \nand that _positive_ 3710 is: \n 00100101 \nIf we wanted to compute 24 + 37, we'd just add these. But instead we're looking for 24 - 37 , so we'll take the complement of 37 to find \n188 CHAPTER 7. NUMBERS \n- 37. Flip all the bits of 37: \n 11011010 \nand add one: 1 1011010 + 1 1 1011011 \nand so now we've determined that in the two's-complement scheme, - 37 is represented by 110110112. \nWe're now ready to compute 24 + (-37): \n 1 1 \n00011000 - this is (^2410) + 11011011 - this is - (^3710) 11110011 So we have our two's-complement answer, 11110011. What value does that correspond to? Well, the left-most bit is a 1, so it's a negative number. To find out what it's the negative _of_ , flip all the bits and add one: 0 0001100 - flip the bits to get + 1 - add one 0 0001101 This is positive 13, which means the number we inverted to get it -- 11110011 -- must represent - 13. And that is indeed the correct answer, for 24 - 37 = - 13. One last word on two's-complement: what is the _range_ of numbers we can represent? It turns out to be -128 to 127. The highest value is 01111111 , which is 127. You might think the lowest value would be represented as 11111111 , but if you work it out, you'll find that this is actually the number - 1. The lowest number is actually the bit pattern 10000000 , which is - 128. **Overflow** One last sticky detail we need to cover has to do with **overflow**. When we add two numbers, there is the possibility that the result \n7.4. BINARY (BASE 2) 189 \nwill contain one more digit than the original numbers did. You've probably seen this on a hand calculator when you press \"=\" and get an \"E\" (for \"error\") in the display. If there are only ten digits on your display, adding two ten-digit numbers will (sometimes) result in an eleven-digit number that your calculator can't display, and it's alerting you to that fact so you don't misinterpret the result. Here, we might add two 8-bit quantities and end up with a 9-bit quantity that can't fit in one byte. This situation is called overflow, and we need to detect when it occurs. \nThe rules for detecting overflow are different depending on the scheme. For _unsigned_ numbers, the rule is simple: if a 1 is carried out from the MSB (far left-side), then we have overflow. So if I were to try to add 15510 and 10810 : \n 1 1 1 1 \n10011011 - (^15510) + 01101100 - (^10810) 1 00001111 then I get a carry out left into the 9th digit. Since we can only hold eight digits in our result, we would get a nonsensical </passage>"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<tool_call>\\n{\"arguments\": {\"queries\": ['Can you summarize the three different schemes for treating negative numbers?', \"What is the difference between the sign-magnitude and two's-complement schemes?\", \"How does the two's-complement scheme handle overflow?\"], \"name\": \"ExpertQAExtractor\"}}\\n</tool_call>"}]}

This will be especially important when you are asked to construct proofs whose conclusion states that two objects are equal. If you have an electronic copy of the book, such as the PDF version, searching on \"Definition CVE\" can be an instructive exercise. See how often, and where, the definition is employed. OK, let us do an example of vector equality that begins to hint at the utility of this definition. Example VESE Vector equality for a system of equations Consider the system of linear equations in Archetype B, - 7 x 1 - 6 x 2 - 12 x 3 = - 33 5 x 1 + 5x 2 + 7x 3 = 24 x 1 + 4x 3 = 5 Note the use of three equals signs -- each indicates an equality of numbers (the linear expressions are numbers when we evaluate them with fixed values of the variable quantities). Now write the vector equality, [ - 7 x 1 - 6 x 2 - 12 x 3 5 x 1 + 5x 2 + 7x 3 x 1 + 4x 3 \n ] = \n [ - 33 24 5 \n ] . \nBy Definition CVE, this single equality (of two column vectors) translates into three simultaneous equalities of numbers that form the system of equations. So with this new notion of vector equality we can become less reliant on referring to systems of simultaneous equations. There is more to vector equality than just this, but this is a good example for starters and we will develop it further. 4 We will now define two operations on the set Cm. By this we mean well-defined procedures that somehow convert vectors into other vectors. Here are two of the most basic definitions of the entire course. Definition CVA Column Vector Addition \n SSVO B e e z e r : A F i r s t C o u r s e i n L i n e a r A l g e b r a 61 \nSuppose that u, v  Cm. The sum of u and v is the vector u + v defined by [u + v]i = [u]i + [v]i 1 <= i <= m \u0003 So vector addition takes two vectors of the same size and combines them (in a natural way!) to create a new vector of the same size. Notice that this definition is required, even if we agree that this is the obvious, right, natural or correct way to do it. Notice too that the symbol '+' is being recycled. We all know how to add numbers, but now we have the same symbol extended to double-duty and we use it to indicate how to add two new objects, vectors. And this definition of our new meaning is built on our previous meaning of addition via the expressions ui + vi. Think about your objects, especially when doing proofs. Vector addition is easy, here is an example from C^4. Example VA Addition of two vectors in C^4 If \n u = \n    \n 2 - 3 4 2 \n    v^ = \n    \n - 1 5 2 - 7 \n    \n then \n u + v = \n    \n 2 - 3 4 2 \n    + \n    \n - 1 5 2 - 7 \n    = \n    \n 2 + (-1) -3 + 5 4 + 2 2 + (-7) \n    = \n    \n 1 2 6 - 5 \n    \n4 Our second operation takes two objects of different types, specifically a number and a vector, and combines them to create another vector. In this context we call a number a scalar in order to emphasize that it is not a vector. Definition CVSM Column Vector Scalar Multiplication Suppose u  Cm^ and a  C, then the scalar multiple of u by a is the vector au defined by [au]i = a [u]i 1 <= i <= m \u0003 Notice that we are doing a kind of multiplication here, but we are defining a new type, perhaps in what appears to be a natural way. We use juxtaposition (smashing two symbols together side-by-side) to denote this operation rather than using a symbol like we did with vector addition. So this can be another source of confusion. When two symbols are next to each other, are we doing regular old multiplication, the kind we have done for years, or are we doing scalar vector multiplication, the operation we just defined? Think about your objects -- if the first object is a scalar, and the second is a vector, then it must be that we are doing our new operation, and the result of this operation will be another vector. Notice how consistency in notation can be an aid here. If we write scalars as lower case Greek letters from the start of the alphabet (such as a, b,... ) and write vectors in bold Latin letters from the end of the alphabet (u, v,... ), then we have some hints about what type of objects we are working with. This can be a blessing and a curse, since when we go read another book about linear algebra, or read an application in another discipline (physics, economics,... ) the types of notation employed may be very different and hence unfamiliar. Again, computationally, vector scalar multiplication is very easy. \n SSVO B e e z e r : A F i r s t C o u r s e i n L i n e a r A l g e b r a 62 \n Example CVSM Scalar multiplication in C^5 If \n u = \n      \n 3 1 - 2 4 - 1 \n      \n and a = 6, then \n au = 6 \n      \n 3 1 - 2 4 - 1 \n      \n = \n      \n 6(3) 6(1) 6(-2) 6(4) 6(-1) \n      \n = \n      \n 18 6 - 12 24 - 6 \n      \n . \n 4 \n##### Subsection VSP \n##### Vector Space Properties \nWith definitions of vector addition and scalar multiplication we can state, and prove, several properties of each operation, and some properties that involve their interplay. We now collect ten of them here for later reference. Theorem VSPCV Vector Space Properties of Column Vectors Suppose that Cm^ is the set of column vectors of size m (Definition VSCV) with addition and scalar multiplication as defined in Definition CVA and Definition CVSM. Then \n- ACC Additive Closure, Column Vectors     If u, v  Cm, then u + v  Cm. \n- SCC Scalar Closure, Column Vectors     If a  C and u  Cm, then au  Cm. \n- CC Commutativity, Column Vectors     If u, v  Cm, then u + v = v + u. \n- AAC Additive Associativity, Column Vectors     If u, v, w  Cm, then u + (v + w) = (u + v) + w. \n- ZC Zero Vector, Column Vectors     There is a vector, 0 , called the zero vector, such that u + 0 = u for all u  Cm. \n- AIC Additive Inverses, Column Vectors     If u  Cm, then there exists a vector -u  Cm^ so that u + (-u) = 0. \n- SMAC Scalar Multiplication Associativity, Column Vectors     If a, b  C and u  Cm, then a(bu) = (ab)u. \n- DVAC Distributivity across Vector Addition, Column Vectors     If a  C and u, v  Cm, then a(u + v) = au + av. \n- DSAC Distributivity across Scalar Addition, Column Vectors     If a, b  C and u  Cm, then (a + b)u = au + bu. \n SSVO B e e z e r : A F i r s t C o u r s e i n L i n e a r A l g e b r a 63 \n- OC One, Column Vectors     If u  Cm, then 1 u = u. \n Proof. While some of these properties seem very obvious, they all require proof. However, the proofs are not very interesting, and border on tedious. We will prove one version of distributivity very carefully, and you can test your proof-building skills on some of the others. We need to establish an equality, so we will do so by beginning with one side of the equality, apply various definitions and theorems (listed to the right of each step) to massage the expression from the left into the expression on the right. Here we go with a proof of Property DSAC. For 1 <= i <= m, [(a + b)u]i = (a + b) [u]i Definition CVSM = a [u]i + b [u]i Property DCN = [au]i + [bu]i Definition CVSM = [au + bu]i Definition CVA \n Since the individual components of the vectors (a + b)u and au + bu are equal for all i, 1 <= i <= m, Definition CVE tells us the vectors are equal. \u0004 \nMany of the conclusions of our theorems can be characterized as \"identities,\" especially when we are establishing basic properties of operations such as those in this section. Most of the properties listed in Theorem VSPCV are examples. So some advice about the style we use for proving identities is appropriate right now. Have a look at Proof Technique PI. Be careful with the notion of the vector -u. This is a vector that we add to u so that the result is the particular vector 0. This is basically a property of vector addition. It happens that we can compute -u using the other operation, scalar multiplication. We can prove this directly by writing that [-u]i = - [u]i = (-1) [u]i = [(-1)u]i We will see later how to derive this property as a consequence of several of the ten properties listed in Theorem VSPCV. Similarly, we will often write something you would immediately recognize as \"vector subtraction.\" This could be placed on a firm theoretical foundation -- as you can do yourself with Exercise VO.T30. A final note. Property AAC implies that we do not have to be careful about how we \"parenthesize\" the addition of vectors. In other words, there is nothing to be gained by writing (u + v) + (w + (x + y)) rather than u + v + w + x + y, since we get the same result no matter which order we choose to perform the four additions. So we will not be careful about using parentheses this way. \n##### Reading Questions \n1. Where have you seen vectors used before in other courses? How were they different? \n2.

A proof can't even get off the ground without axioms. For instance, in step 1 of the above proof, we noted that either A or B must be true, and so if B isn't true, then A must be. But we couldn't have taken this step without knowing that disjunctive syllogism is a valid form of reasoning. It's not important to know all the technical names of the rules that I included in parentheses. But it is important to see that we made use of an axiom of reasoning on every step, and that if any of those axioms were incorrect, it could lead to a faulty conclusion. \nWhen you create a valid proof, the result is a new bit of knowledge called a **theorem** which can be used in future proofs. Think of a theorem like a subroutine in programming: a separate bit of code that does a job and can be invoked at will in the course of doing other things. One theorem we learned in chapter 2 was the distributive property of sets; that is, that X  (Y  Z) = (X  Y)  (X  Z). This can be proven through the use of Venn diagrams, but once you've proven it, it's accepted to be true, and can be used as a \"given\" in future proofs. \n**9.2 Types of proof** \nThere are a number of accepted \"styles\" of doing proofs. Here are some important ones: \n**Direct proof** \nThe examples we've used up to now have been **direct proof** s. This is where you start from what's known and proceed directly by positive steps towards your conclusion. \nDirect proofs remind me of a game called \"word ladders,\" invented by Lewis Carroll, that you might have played as a child: \n WARM |||| ???? |||| \n228 CHAPTER 9. PROOF \n COLD \nYou start with one word (like WARM) and you have to come up with a sequence of words, _each of which differs from the previous by only one letter_ , such that you eventually reach the ending word (like COLD). It's sort of like feeling around in the dark: \n WARM WART WALT WILT WILD |||| .... \nThis attempt seemed promising at first, but now it looks like it's going nowhere. (\"WOLD?\" \"CILD?\" Hmm....) After starting over and playing around with it for a while, you might stumble upon: \n WARM WORM WORD CORD COLD \nThis turned out to be a pretty direct path: for each step, the letter we changed was exactly what we needed it to be for the target word COLD. Sometimes, though, you have to meander away from the target a little bit to find a solution, like going from BLACK to WHITE: \n BLACK CLACK CRACK TRACK TRICK TRICE \n9.2. TYPES OF PROOF 229 \n TRITE WRITE WHITE \nHere, we had to temporarily change our first letter three different times -- two of which seemingly brought us no nearer to WHITE -- in order to successfully forge a path through the tangled forest. \nKnowing which direction to set out on is a matter of intuition plus trial and error. Given the axioms of any system (whether algebra, predicate logic, sets, _etc._ ) there are an unfathomable number of different ways to proceed. The vast majority of them are bound to lead to dead ends. This is why a valid proof, when it is finished, is often an elegant and beautiful thing. It's a thin braid of jewels glistening in the midst of a whole lot of mud. \n**Indirect proof** \nAlso known as a **proof by contradiction** or **_reductio ad absurdum_** , the **indirect proof** starts in a completely opposite way. It says, \"okay, I'm trying to prove X. Well, suppose for the sake of argument I assume that the opposite -- _not_ X -- is true. Where would that lead me?\" If you follow all the rules and it leads you to a contradiction, this tells you that the original assumption of !X must have been false. And this in turn proves that X must be true. \nWe do this all the time in our thinking. Say you're driving down the highway. How do you _know_ that the alternator in your car engine is working? A direct proof would require that you open the hood and examine the part, testing to ensure it works properly. An indirect proof simply says, \"well, suppose it _weren't_ working properly. Then, my car engine wouldn't operate. But here I am, driving down the road, and the engine obviously _does_ operate, so that tells me that the alternator must be working properly.\" \nOne of the most famous indirect proofs dates from Euclid's _Elements_ in 300 B.C. It proves that the square root of 2 is an irrational number, a great surprise to mathematicians at the time (most of whom doubted the very existence of irrational numbers). Remem\n230 CHAPTER 9. PROOF \nber that an irrational number is one that _cannot_ be expressed as the ratio of two integers, no matter what the integers are. \nProving this directly seems pretty hard, since how do you prove that there _aren't_ any two integers whose ratio is \n 2 , no matter how hard you looked? I mean, 534,927 and 378,250 are pretty dang close: \n ( 534 , 927 378 , 250 \n ) 2 = 2. 000005. \nHow could we possibly prove that no matter how hard we look, we can never find a pair that will give it to us exactly? \nOne way is to assume that \n 2 _is_ a rational number, and then prove that down that path lies madness. It goes like this. Suppose \n 2 is rational, after all. That means that there must be two integers, call them a and b, whose ratio is exactly equal to \n  2 : \n a b = \n  2. \nThis, then, is the starting point for our indirect proof. We're going to proceed under this assumption and see where it leads us. \nBy the way, it's clear that we could always reduce this fraction to lowest terms in case it's not already. For instance, if a = 6 and b = 4, then our fraction would be 64 , which is the same as 32 , so we could just say a = 3 and b = 2 and start over. Bottom line: if 2 is rational, then we can find two integers a and b that have no common factor (if they do have a common factor, we'll just divide it out of both of them and go with the new numbers) whose ratio is \n  2. \nOkay then. But now look what happens. Suppose we square both \n9.3. PROOF BY INDUCTION 231 \nsides of the equation (a perfectly legal thing to do): a b \n = \n  2 ( a b \n ) 2 = ( \n  2)^2 \n a^2 b^2 = 2 a^2 = 2b^2. \nNow if a^2 equals 2 times something, then a^2 is an even number. But a^2 can't be even unless a itself is even. (Think hard about that one.) This proves, then, that a is even. Very well. It must be equal to twice some other integer. Let's call that c. We know that a = 2c, where c is another integer. Substitute that into the last equation and we get: \n (2c)^2 = 2b^2 4 c^2 = 2b^2 2 c^2 = b^2. \nSo it looks like b^2 must be an even number as well (since it's equal to 2 times something), and therefore b is also even. But wait a minute. We started by saying that a and b _had no common factor_. And now we've determined that they're both even numbers! This means they both have a factor of 2, which contradicts what we started with. The only thing we introduced that was questionable was the notion that there _are_ two integers a and b whose ratio was equal to \n 2 to begin with. That must be the part that's faulty then. Therefore, \n  2 is not an irrational number. Q.E.D. \n**9.3 Proof by induction** \nOne of the most powerful methods of proof -- and one of the most difficult to wrap your head around -- is called **mathematical induction** , or just \"induction\" for short. I like to call it \"proof by \n232 CHAPTER 9. PROOF \nrecursion,\" because this is exactly what it is. Remember that we discussed recursion in the context of rooted trees (see p.116). A tree can be thought of as a node with several children -- each of which are, in turn, trees. Each of _them_ is the root node of a tree comprised of yet smaller trees, and so on and so forth. If you flip back to the left-hand side of Figure 5.16 on p.113, you'll see that A is the root of one tree, and its two children, F and B, are roots of their own smaller trees in turn. If we were to traverse this tree in (say) pre-order, we'd visit the root, then visit the left and right subtrees in turn, treating each of them as their _own_ tree. In this way we've broken up a larger problem (traversing the big tree) into smaller problems (traversing the smaller trees F and B). The A node has very little to do: it just visits itself, then defers all the rest of the work onto its children. This idea of pawning off most of the work onto smaller subproblems _that you trust will work_ is key to the idea of inductive proofs. \nMathematical induction is hard to wrap your head around because it feels like cheating. It seems like you never actually prove anything: you defer all the work to someone else, and then declare victory. But the chain of reasoning, though delicate, is strong as iron. \n**Casting the problem in the right form** \nLet's examine that chain. The first thing you have to be able to do is express the thing you're trying to prove as _a predicate about natural numbers_. In other words, you need to form a predicate that has one input, which is a natural number. You're setting yourself up to prove that the predicate is true _for all natural numbers._ (Or at least, all natural numbers of at least a certain size.) \nSuppose I want to prove that in the state of Virginia, all legal drinkers can vote. Then I could say \"let Vote(n) be the proposition that a citizen of age n can vote.\" \nIf I want to prove an algebraic identity, like \n x i=1 \n i = x(x 2 +1) , then I \nhave to figure out which variable is the one that needs to vary across the natural numbers. In this case it's the x variable in my equation. \n9.3. PROOF BY INDUCTION 233 \nSo I'll say \"let P(n) be the proposition that \n n i=1 \n i = n(n 2 +1) .\" (The \nchoice of the letter \"n\" isn't important here -- it just needs to be a letter that stands for a number. We could have chosen anything, even sticking with x. Later, we'll use \"k\" as a stand-in, so keep your eyes peeled for that.) \nIf I want to prove that the number of leaves in a perfect binary tree is one more than the number of internal nodes, I'd have to think about which _quantity_ I can parameterize on ( _i.e._ , which quantity I can use for my n.) In this case, I'd probably use the _height_ of the tree. I'd say \"let P(n) be the proposition that the number of leaves in a perfect binary tree of height n is one more than the number of internal nodes.\" \nThese are just examples. In any case, you need to cast your proof in a form that allows you to make statements in terms of the natural numbers. Then you're ready to begin the process of proving by induction that your predicate is true for _all_ the natural numbers. \n**Proof by induction: weak form** \nThere are actually two forms of induction, the weak form and the strong form. Let's look at the **weak form** first. It says: \n1. _If_ a predicate is true for a certain number, \n2. _and_ its being true for some number would reliably mean that     it's also true for the next number ( _i.e._ , one number greater), \n3. _then_ it's true for all numbers. \nAll you have to do is prove those two things, and you've effectively proven it for every case. \nThe first step is called the **base case** , and the \"certain number\" we pick is normally either 0 or 1. The second step, called the **inductive step** , is where all the trouble lies. You have to look really, really carefully at how it's worded, above. We are _not_ assuming \n234 CHAPTER 9. PROOF \nthat the predicate is true for any old number! We are simply considering, _if_ it's true for any old number, whether that would necessarily imply it's also true for the next number. In terms of the predicate, we're asking \"does P(k) imply P(k +1)?\" In other words: \"we aren't sure if P(k) is true. But if it is -- a big \"if,\" of course -- would that logically demand that P(k + 1) was also true?\" If you can prove that it does, then you're in business. </passage>"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<tool_call>\\n{\"arguments\": {\"queries\": ['In your opinion, which type of proof is the most powerful?', 'Do you think that mathematical induction is a difficult concept to understand?', 'Can you give an example of a situation where proof by recursion is the most appropriate method?'], \"name\": \"ExpertQAExtractor\"}}\\n</tool_call>"}]}

If one domino falls, then the one after it will also fall. And if that one falls, then so will the next. All that is needed is a base case to tip over the first domino, and by this trail of causality, _all_ the dominos will fall. \nOne terminology note: the entire second step is called the inductive step, but the first half of it (the part where we assume that P(k) is true) is called the **inductive hypothesis**. We never prove the inductive hypothesis; rather, we assume it, and then see if that allows us to deduce that P(k + 1) would also be true. \n**Example 1** \nLet's work this out for the drinking/voting example. Let Vote(n) be the proposition that a citizen of age n can vote. Our proof goes like this: \n1. **base case.** Vote(21) is true, because a 21-year old is old     enough to vote in the state and national elections. \n2. **inductive step.** Vote(k)=Vote(k+1). Why? Because     nobody's gettin' any younger. If you can vote in a particular     year, then you're also old enough to vote next year. Unless     the laws change, there will never be a case when someone old     enough to vote this year turns out to be too young to vote     next year. \n3. **conclusion.** Wow. n >= 21 Vote(n). We're done. _Q.E.D._     and all that. \nThe only specific example we showed was true was Vote(21). And yet we managed to prove Vote(n) for _any_ number n >= 21. \n9.3. PROOF BY INDUCTION 235 \nLet's look back at that inductive step, because that's where all the action is. It's crucial to understand what that step does _not_ say. It doesn't say \"Vote(k) is true for some number k.\" If it did, then since k's value is arbitrary at that point, we would basically be assuming the very thing we were supposed to prove, which is circular reasoning and extremely unconvincing. But that's not what we did. Instead, we made the inductive hypothesis and said, \"okay then, let's assume for a second a 40-year-old can vote. We don't know for sure, but let's say she can. Now, if that's indeed true, can a 41-year-old also vote? The answer is yes.\" We might have said, \"okay then, let's assume for a second a 7-year-old can vote. We don't know for sure, but let's say she can. Now, if that's indeed true, can an 8-year-old also vote? The answer is yes.\" Note carefully that we did _not_ say that 8-year-olds can vote! We merely said that _if_ 7-year-olds can, why then 8-year-olds must be able to as well. Remember that X=Y is true if either X is false or Y is true (or both). In the 7/8-year-old example, the premise X turns out to be false, so this doesn't rule out our implication. \nThe result is a row of falling dominos, up to whatever number we wish. Say we want to verify that a **25-year-old** can vote. Can we be sure? Well: \n1. If a 24-year-old can vote, then that would sure prove it (by     the inductive step). \n2. So now we need to verify that a 24-year-old can vote. Can he?     Well, if a 23-year-old can vote, then that would sure prove it     (by the inductive step). \n3. Now everything hinges on whether a 23-year-old can vote.     Can he? Well, if a 22-year-old can vote, then that would sure     prove it (by the inductive step). \n4. So it comes down to whether a 22-year-old can vote. Can he?     Well, if a 21-year-old can vote, then that would sure prove it     (by the inductive step). \n5. And now we need to verify whether a 21-year-old can vote.     Can he? Yes (by the base case). \n236 CHAPTER 9. PROOF \n**Example 2** \nA famous story tells of Carl Friedrich Gauss, perhaps the most brilliant mathematician of all time, getting in trouble one day as a schoolboy. As punishment, he was sentenced to tedious work: adding together all the numbers from 1 to 100. To his teacher's astonishment, he came up with the correct answer in a moment, not because he was quick at adding integers, but because he recognized a trick. The first number on the list (1) and the last (100) add up to 101. So do the second number (2) and the second-to-last (99). So do 3 and 98, and so do 4 and 97, _etc._ , all the way up to 50 and \n51. So really what you have here is 50 different sums of 101 each, so the answer is 50 x 101 = 5050. In general, if you add the numbers from 1 to x, where x is any integer at all, you'll get x 2 sums of x + 1 \neach, so the answer will be x(x 2 +1). \nNow, use mathematical induction to prove that Gauss was right \n( _i.e._ , that \n x i=1 \n i = x(x 2 +1) ) for all numbers x. \nFirst we have to cast our problem as a predicate about natural numbers. This is easy: we say \"let P(n) be the proposition that ^ n \ni=1 \n i = n(n 2 +1) .\" \nThen, we satisfy the requirements of induction: \n1. **base case.** We prove that P(1) is true simply by plugging it     in. Setting n = 1 we have \n ^1 \n i=1 \n i = 1(1 + 1)? 2 \n 1 = 1(2)? 2 1 = 1 X \n2. **inductive step.** We now must prove that P(k)=P(k + 1).     Put another way, we _assume_ P(k) is true, and then use that     assumption to prove that P(k + 1) is also true. \n9.3. PROOF BY INDUCTION 237 \n Let's be crystal clear where we're going with this. Assuming that P(k) is true means we can count on the fact that \n 1 + 2 + 3 + * * * + k = \n k(k + 1) 2 . \n What we need to do, then, is prove that P(k + 1) is true, which amounts to proving that \n 1 + 2 + 3 + * * * + (k + 1) = ( \n k + 1)((k + 1) + 1) 2 . \n Very well. First we make the inductive hypothesis, which allows us to assume: \n 1 + 2 + 3 + * * * + k = k(k + 1) 2 \n . \n The rest is just algebra. We add k + 1 to both sides of the equation, then multiply things out and factor it all together. Watch carefully: \n 1 + 2 + 3 + * * * + k + (k + 1) = k(k + 1) 2 \n + (k + 1) \n = 1 2 k^2 + 1 2 k + k + 1 \n = 1 2 k^2 + 3 2 k + 1 \n = \n k^2 + 3k + 2 2 = ( \n k + 1)(k + 2) 2 = ( \n k + 1)((k + 1) + 1) 2 \n. X \n3. **conclusion.** Therefore, n >= 1 P(n). \n**Example 3** \nAnother algebra one. You learned in middle school that (ab)n^ = anbn. Prove this by mathematical induction. \nSolution: Let P(n) be the proposition that (ab)n^ = anbn. \n238 CHAPTER 9. PROOF \n1. **base case.** We prove that P(1) is true simply by plugging it     in. Setting n = 1 we have \n (ab)^1 =? a^1 b^1 ab = ab X \n2. **inductive step.** We now must prove that P(k)=P(k + 1).     Put another way, we _assume_ P(k) is true, and then use that     assumption to prove that P(k + 1) is also true.     Let's be crystal clear where we're going with this. Assuming     that P(k) is true means we can count on the fact that \n (ab)k^ = akbk. \n What we need to do, then, is prove that P(k + 1) is true, which amounts to proving that \n (ab)k+1^ = ak+1bk+1. \n Now we know by the very definition of exponents that: \n (ab)k+1^ = ab(ab)k. \n Adding in our inductive hypothesis then lets us determine: \n (ab)k+1^ = ab(ab)k = ab * akbk = a * ak^ * b * bk = ak+1bk+1^ X \n3. **conclusion.** Therefore, n >= 1 P(n). \n9.3. PROOF BY INDUCTION 239 \n**Example 4** \nLet's switch gears and talk about structures. Prove that the number of leaves in a perfect binary tree is one more than the number of internal nodes. \nSolution: let P(n) be the proposition that a perfect binary tree of height n has one more leaf than internal node. That is, if lk is the number of _l_ eaves in a tree of height k, and ik is the number of _i_ nternal nodes in a tree of height k, let P(n) be the proposition that ln = in + 1. \n1. **base case.** We prove that P(0) is true simply by inspection.     If we have a tree of height 0, then it has only one node (the     root). This sole node is a leaf, and is not an internal node. So     this tree has 1 leaf, and 0 internal nodes, and so l 0 = i 0 + 1.     X \n2. **inductive step.** We now must prove that P(k)=P(k + 1).     Put another way, we _assume_ P(k) is true, and then use that     assumption to prove that P(k + 1) is also true.     Let's be crystal clear where we're going with this. Assuming     that P(k) is true means we can count on the fact that \n lk = ik + 1. \n What we need to do, then, is prove that P(k + 1) is true, which amounts to proving that \n lk+1 = ik+1 + 1. \n We begin by noting that the number of nodes on level k of a perfect binary tree is 2 k. This is because the root is only one node, it has two children (giving 2 nodes on level 1), both those children have two children (giving 4 nodes on level 2), all four of those children have two children (giving 8 nodes on level 3), etc. Therefore, lk = 2k, and lk+1 = 2k+1. Further, we observe that ik+1 = ik + lk: this is just how trees work. In words, suppose we have a perfect binary tree of \n240 CHAPTER 9. PROOF \n height k, and we add another level of nodes to it, making it a perfect binary tree of height k + 1. Then all of the first tree's nodes (whether internal or leaves) become internal nodes of bigger tree. Combining these two facts, we have ik+1 = ik + 2k. By the inductive hypothesis, we assume that 2 k^ = ik + </passage>"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<tool_call>\\n{\"arguments\": {\"queries\": ['Can you provide an example of a problem that could be solved using mathematical induction and explain how you would approach it?', 'How can one identify and troubleshoot errors or mistakes in a mathematical induction proof?', 'In your opinion, what is the most challenging aspect of troubleshooting in mathematical induction?'], \"name\": \"ExpertQAExtractor\"}}\\n</tool_call>"}]}

This may seem like a hopeless endeavor, sort of like knowing the unknowable, but it's not. The study of probability gives us tools for taming the uncertain world we live and program in, and for reasoning about it in a precise and helpful way. \nWe may not know exactly how long a particular visitor is willing to wait for our webpage to load in their browser, but we can use probability to estimate how much traffic we'll lose if this takes longer than a certain average duration. We may not know which specific passwords a hacker will try as he attempts to break our security protocol, but we can use probability to estimate how feasible this approach will be for him. We may not know exactly when a certain program will run out of RAM and have to swap its data out to virtual memory, but we can predict how often this is likely to occur -- and how painful it will be for us -- given a certain system load and user behavior. \nThe trick is to use the tools we've already built -- sets, relations, functions -- to characterize and structure our notions of the relative likelihood of various outcomes. Once those underpinnings are secured, a layer of deductive reasoning will help us make good use of that information to begin to predict the future. \n 59 \n60 CHAPTER 4. PROBABILITY \n**4.1 Outcomes and events** \nSince life is uncertain, we don't know for sure what is going to happen. But let's start by assuming we know what things _might_ happen. Something that might happen is called an **outcome**. You can think of this as the result of an experiment if you want to, although normally we won't be talking about outcomes that we have explicitly manipulated and measured via scientific means. It's more like we're just curious how some particular happening is going to turn out, and we've identified the different ways it can turn out and called them outcomes. \nNow we've been using the symbol ohm to refer to \"the domain of discourse\" or \"the universal set\" or \"all the stuff we're talking about.\" We're going to give it yet another name now: the **sample space**. ohm, the sample space, is simply _the set of all possible outcomes._ Any particular outcome -- call it O -- is an element of this set, just like in chapter 1 every conceivable element was a member of the domain of discourse. \nIf a woman is about to have a baby, we might define ohm as { boy, girl }. Any particular outcome o is either boy or girl (not both), but both outcomes are in the sample space, because both are possible. If we roll a die, we'd define ohm as { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 }. If we're interested in motor vehicle safety, we might define ohm for a particular road trip as { safe, accident }. The outcomes don't have to be equally likely, an important point we'll return to soon. \nIn probability, we define an **event** as _a subset of the sample space_. In other words, an event is a _group_ of related outcomes (though an event might contain just one outcome, or even zero). I always thought this was a funny definition for the word \"event\": it's not the first thing that word brings to mind. But it turns out to be a useful concept, because sometimes we're not interested in any _particular_ outcome necessarily, but rather in whether the outcome -- whatever it is -- has a certain property. For instance, suppose at the start of some game, my opponent and I each roll the die, agreeing that the highest roller gets to go first. Suppose he rolls a \n2. Now it's my turn. The ohm for my die roll is of course { 1, 2, 3, \n4.2. PROBABILITY MEASURES 61 \n4, 5, 6 }. But in this case, it doesn't necessarily matter what my specific outcome is; only whether I beat a 2. So I could define the _event_ M (for \"me first\") to be the set { 3, 4, 5, 6 }. I could define the event H (\"him first\") to be the set { 1 } (notice H is still a set, even though it has only one element.) Then I could define the event T (\"tie\") as the set { 2 }. I've now effectively collapsed a larger set of outcomes into only the groups of outcomes I'm interested in. Now I'm all ready to reason about the likelihood that each of these events actually occurs. \nBy the way, \"the set of all outcomes\" is simply ohm, since an outcome is an element of ohm. But an event is a _subset_ of ohm, not a single element. What, then, is \"the set of all events?\" If you think it through, you'll realize that it's P(ohm) (the _power set_ of the sample space). Put another way, when defining an event, I can choose any subset of the possible outcomes, and so I can choose any set from P(ohm). \n**4.2 Probability measures** \nOkay, we've defined sample spaces and events, but when do quantitative notions like \"the odds of\" and \"percent chance\" come into play? They enter the scene when we define a **probability measure**. A probability measure is simply _a function from the domain of events to the codomain of real numbers._ We'll normally use the letters \"Pr\" for our probability measure. In symbols, Pr : P(ohm) - R (since the set of all events is the power set of the sample space, as per above). There's actually another constraint, though, which is that Pr's values must be in the range 0 to 1, inclusive. So it's more correct to write: Pr : P(ohm) - [0, 1]. (You may recall from a previous math course that '[' and ']' are used to describe a closed interval in which the endpoints are included in the interval.) \nThe \"meaning\" of the probability measure is intuitive enough: it indicates how likely we think each event is to occur. In the baby example, if we say Pr({boy}) = .5, it means there's a .5 probability (a.k.a., a 50% chance) that a male child will be born. In the game example, if we say Pr(M ) = .667, if means there's a two-thirds \n62 CHAPTER 4. PROBABILITY \nchance of me winning the right to go first. In all cases, a probability of 0 means \"impossible to occur\" and a probability of 1 means \"absolutely certain to occur.\" In colloquial English, we most often use percentages to talk about these things: we'll say \"there's a 60% chance Biden will win the election\" rather than \"there's a .6 probability of Biden winning.\" The math's a bit clumsier if we deal with percentages, though, so from now on we'll get in the habit of using probabilities rather than 'percent chances,' and we'll use values in the 0 to 1 range rather than 0 to 100. \nI find the easiest way to think about probability measures is to start with the probabilities of the _outcomes_ , not events. Each outcome has a specific probability of occuring. The probabilities of events logically flow from that just by using addition, as we'll see in a moment. \nFor example, let's imagine that Fox Broadcasting is producing a worldwide television event called _All-time Idol_ , in which the yearly winners of _American Idol_ throughout its history all compete against each other to be crowned the \"All-time American Idol champion.\" The four contestants chosen for this competition, along with their musical genres, and age when originally appearing on the show, are as follows: Kelly Clarkson (20): pop, rock, R&B Fantasia Barrino (20): pop, R&B Carrie Underwood (22): country David Cook (26): rock \nEntertainment shows, gossip columns, and _People_ magazine are all abuzz in the weeks preceding the competition, to the point where a shrewd analyst can estimate the probabilities of each contestant winning. Our current best estimates are: Kelly .2, Fantasia .2, Carrie .1, and David .5. \nComputing the probability for a specific event is just a matter of adding up the probabilities of its outcomes. Define F as the event that a woman wins the competition. Clearly Pr(F ) = .5, since Pr({Kelly}) = .2, Pr({Fantasia}) = .2, and Pr({Carrie}) = .1. If P is the event that a rock singer wins, Pr(P ) = .7, since this is the sum of Kelly's and David's probabilities. \n4.2. PROBABILITY MEASURES 63 \nNow it turns out that not just _any_ function will do as a probability measure, even if the domain (events) and codomain (real numbers in the range[0,1]) are correct. In order for a function to be a \"valid\" probability measure, it must satisfy several other rules: \n1. Pr(ohm) = 1 \n2. Pr(A) >= 0 for all A  ohm \n3. Pr(A  B) = Pr(A) + Pr(B) - Pr(A  B) \nRule 1 basically means \" _something_ has to happen.\" If we create an event that includes every possible outcome, then there's a probability of 1 (100% chance) the event will occur, because after all _some_ outcome has got to occur. (And of course Pr(ohm) can't be _greater_ than 1, either, because it doesn't make sense to have any probability over 1.) Rule 2 says there's no negative probabilities: you can't define any event, no matter how remote, that has a less than zero chance of happening. \nRule 3 is called the \"additivity property,\" and is a bit more difficult to get your head around. A diagram works wonders. Consider Figure 4.1, called a \"Venn diagram,\" which visually depicts sets and their contents. Here we have defined three events: F (as above) is the event that the winner is a woman; R is the event that the winner is a rock musician (perhaps in addition to other musical genres); and U is the event that the winner is underage ( _i.e._ , becomes a multimillionare before they can legally drink). Each of these events is depicted as a closed curve which encloses the outcomes that belong to it. There is obviously a great deal of overlap. \nNow back to rule 3. Suppose I ask \"what's the probability that the All-time Idol winner is underage or a rock star?\" Right away we face an irritating ambiguity in the English language: does \"or\" mean \" _either_ underage _or_ a rock star, but not both?\" Or does it mean \"underage _and/or_ rock star?\" The former interpretation is called an **exclusive or** and the latter an **inclusive or**. In computer science, we will almost always be assuming an _inclusive_ or, unless explicitly noted otherwise. \n64 CHAPTER 4. PROBABILITY \n Kelly (.2) \n David (.5) \n Fantasia (.2) \n Carrie (.1) \n Underage Female \n Rockstar \n Figure 4.1: Various events, and their overlap. \nVery well then. What we're really asking here is \"what's Pr(U  R)?\" We want the union of the two events, since we're asking for the probability that _either_ (or both) of them occurs. You might first think that we'd add the two probabilities for the two events and be done with it, but a glance at the diagram tells you this means trouble. Pr(U ) is .4, and Pr(R) is .7. Even if we weren't very smart, we'd know something was wrong as soon as we added .4 + .7 = 1. 1 to get a probability of over 1 and violate rule 1. But we are smart, and looking at the diagram it's easy to see what happened: _we double-counted Kelly's probability._ Kelly was a member of both groups, so her .2 got counted in there twice. Now you can see the rationale for rule 3. To get Pr(U  R) we add Pr(U ) and Pr(R), but then we have to subtract back out the part we double-counted. And what did we double-count? Precisely the intersection U  R. \nAs a second example, suppose we want the probability of an underage or female winner? Pr(U ) = .4, and Pr(F ) = .5, so the first step is to just add these. Then we subtract out the intersection, which we double counted. In this case, the intersection U  F is just U (check the diagram), and so subtract out the whole .4. The answer is .5, as it should be. \nBy the way, you </passage>"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<tool_call>\\n{\"arguments\": {\"queries\": ['How do the concepts of sample space, outcomes, and events relate to each other in the context of probability?', 'Can you explain the connection between the rules for a valid probability measure and the concept of double-counting?', 'How do the concepts of exclusive or and inclusive or relate to the addition and subtraction of probabilities in calculating events?'], \"name\": \"ExpertQAExtractor\"}}\\n</tool_call>"}]}

So you will make the decision to set daily fancy mix production at f = 825. This has the effect of setting b = 4(825) - 3300 = 0 and we stop producing bulk mix entirely. So the remainder of your daily production is standard mix at the level of s = -5(825) + 4800 = 675 kilograms and the resulting daily profit is (- 1 .04)(825) + 3663 = 2805. It is a pleasant surprise that daily profit has risen to $2,805, but this is not the most important part of the story. What is important here is that there are a large number of ways to produce trail mix that use all of the day's worth of raw ingredients and you were able to easily choose the one that netted the largest profit. Notice too how all of the above computations look \"linear.\" In the food industry, things do not stay the same for long, and now the sales department says that increased competition has led to the decision to stay competitive and charge just $5.25 for a kilogram of the standard mix, rather than the previous $5.50 per kilogram. This decision has no effect on the possibilities for the production schedule, but will affect the decision based on profit considerations. So you revisit just the profit computation, suitably adjusted for the new selling price of standard mix, \n(4f - 3300)(4. 99 - 3 .70) + (- 5 f + 4800)(5. 25 - 3 .85) + (f )(6. 50 - 4 .45) = 0. 21 f + 2463 Now it would appear that fancy mix is beneficial to the company's profit since the value of f has a positive coefficient. So you take the decision to make as much fancy mix as possible, setting f = 960. This leads to s = -5(960) + 4800 = 0 and the increased competition has driven you out of the standard mix market all together. The remainder of production is therefore bulk mix at a daily level of b = 4(960) - 3300 = 540 kilograms and the resulting daily profit is 0.21(960) + 2463 = 2664.60. A daily profit of $2,664.60 is less than it used to be, but as production manager, you have made the best of a difficult situation and shown the sales department that the best course is to pull out of the highly competitive standard mix market completely. 4 \nThis example is taken from a field of mathematics variously known by names such as operations research, systems science, or management science. More specifically, this is a prototypical example of problems that are solved by the techniques of \"linear programming.\" There is a lot going on under the hood in this example. The heart of the matter is the solution to systems of linear equations, which is the topic of the next few sections, and a recurrent theme throughout this course. We will return to this example on several occasions to reveal some of the reasons for its behavior. \n##### Reading Questions \n1. Is the equation x^2 + xy + tan(y^3 ) = 0 linear or not? Why or why not? \n2. Find all solutions to the system of two linear equations 2x + 3y = -8, x - y = 6. \n3.

For example, it costs $3.69 to make one kilogram of the bulk variety. Re-compute each of these three costs and notice that the computations are linear in character. \nM70+^ In Example TMP two different prices were considered for marketing standard mix with the revised recipes (one-third peanuts in each recipe). Selling standard mix at $5.50 resulted in selling the minimum amount of the fancy mix and no bulk mix. At $5.25 it was best for profits to sell the maximum amount of fancy mix and then sell no standard mix. Determine a selling price for standard mix that allows for maximum profits while still selling some of each type of mix. \n### Section SSLE \n### Solving Systems of Linear Equations \n We will motivate our study of linear algebra by considering the problem of solving several linear equations simultaneously. The word \"solve\" tends to get abused somewhat, as in \"solve this problem.\" When talking about equations we understand a more precise meaning: find all of the values of some variable quantities that make an equation, or several equations, simultaneously true. \n##### Subsection SLE \n##### Systems of Linear Equations \n Our first example is of a type we will not pursue further. While it has two equations, the first is not linear. So this is a good example to come back to later, especially after you have seen Theorem PSSLS. Example STNE Solving two (nonlinear) equations Suppose we desire the simultaneous solutions of the two equations, x^2 + y^2 = 1 -x + \n  3 y = 0 \n You can easily check by substitution that x = \n  3 2 , y^ =^ \n 1 2 and^ x^ =^ -^ \n  3 2 , y^ =^ -^ \n 1 2 are both solutions. We need to also convince ourselves that these are the only solutions. To see this, plot each equation on the xy-plane, which means to plot (x, y) pairs that make an individual equation true. In this case we get a circle centered at the origin with radius 1 and a straight line through the origin with slope ^13. The intersections of these two curves are our desired simultaneous solutions, and so we believe from our plot that the two solutions we know already are indeed the only ones. We like to write solutions as sets, so in this case we write the set of solutions as \n S = \n{( (^)  3 2 ,^ 1 2 ) , ( -  3 2 ,^ -^ 1 2 )} 4 In order to discuss systems of linear equations carefully, we need a precise definition. And before we do that, we will introduce our periodic discussions about \"Proof Techniques.\" Linear algebra is an excellent setting for learning how to read, understand and formulate proofs. But this is a difficult step in your development as a mathematician, so we have included a series of short essays containing advice and explanations to help you along. These will be referenced in the text as needed, and are also collected as a list you can consult when you want to return to re-read them. (Which is strongly encouraged!) With a definition next, now is the time for the first of our proof techniques. So study Proof Technique D. We'll be right here when you get back. See you in a bit. Definition SLE System of Linear Equations A system of linear equations is a collection of m equations in the variable quantities x 1 , x 2 , x 3 ,... , xn of the form, a 11 x 1 + a 12 x 2 + a 13 x 3 + * * * + a 1 nxn = b 1 a 21 x 1 + a 22 x 2 + a 23 x 3 + * * * + a 2 nxn = b 2 a 31 x 1 + a 32 x 2 + a 33 x 3 + * * * + a 3 nxn = b 3 .. . \n SSS S L E B e e z e r : A F i r s t C o u r s e i n L i n e a r A l g e b r a 8 \nam 1 x 1 + am 2 x 2 + am 3 x 3 + * * * + amnxn = bm where the values of aij , bi and xj , 1 <= i <= m, 1 <= j <= n, are from the set of complex numbers, C. \u0003 Do not let the mention of the complex numbers, C, rattle you. We will stick with real numbers exclusively for many more sections, and it will sometimes seem like we only work with integers! However, we want to leave the possibility of complex numbers open, and there will be occasions in subsequent sections where they are necessary. You can review the basic properties of complex numbers in Section CNO, but these facts will not be critical until we reach Section O. Now we make the notion of a solution to a linear system precise. Definition SSLE Solution of a System of Linear Equations A solution of a system of linear equations in n variables, x 1 , x 2 , x 3 ,... , xn (such as the system given in Definition SLE), is an ordered list of n complex numbers, s 1 , s 2 , s 3 ,... , sn such that if we substitute s 1 for x 1 , s 2 for x 2 , s 3 for x 3 ,... , sn for xn, then for every equation of the system the left side will equal the right side, i.e. each equation is true simultaneously. \u0003 More typically, we will write a solution in a form like x 1 = 12, x 2 = -7, x 3 = 2 to mean that s 1 = 12, s 2 = -7, s 3 = 2 in the notation of Definition SSLE. To discuss all of the possible solutions to a system of linear equations, we now define the set of all solutions. (So Section SET is now applicable, and you may want to go and familiarize yourself with what is there.) Definition SSSLE Solution Set of a System of Linear Equations The solution set of a linear system of equations is the set which contains every solution to the system, and nothing more. \u0003 Be aware that a solution set can be infinite, or there can be no solutions, in which case we write the solution set as the empty set,  = {} (Definition ES). Here is an example to illustrate using the notation introduced in Definition SLE and the notion of a solution (Definition SSLE). Example NSE Notation for a system of equations Given the system of linear equations, x 1 + 2x 2 + x 4 = 7 x 1 + x 2 + x 3 - x 4 = 3 3 x 1 + x 2 + 5x 3 - 7 x 4 = 1 we have n = 4 variables and m = 3 equations. Also, a 11 = 1 a 12 = 2 a 13 = 0 a 14 = 1 b 1 = 7 a 21 = 1 a 22 = 1 a 23 = 1 a 24 = - 1 b 2 = 3 a 31 = 3 a 32 = 1 a 33 = 5 a 34 = - 7 b 3 = 1 Additionally, convince yourself that x 1 = -2, x 2 = 4, x 3 = 2, x 4 = 1 is one solution (Definition SSLE), but it is not the only one! For example, another solution is x 1 = -12, x 2 = 11, x 3 = 1, x 4 = -3, and there are more to be found. So the solution set contains at least two elements. 4 We will often shorten the term \"system of linear equations\" to \"system of equations\" leaving the linear aspect implied. After all, this is a book about linear algebra. \n SSS S L E B e e z e r : A F i r s t C o u r s e i n L i n e a r A l g e b r a 9 \n##### Subsection PSS \n##### Possibilities for Solution Sets \nThe next example illustrates the possibilities for the solution set of a system of linear equations. We will not be too formal here, and the necessary theorems to back up our claims will come in subsequent sections. So read for feeling and come back later to revisit this example. Example TTS Three typical systems Consider the system of two equations with two variables, 2 x 1 + 3x 2 = 3 x 1 - x 2 = 4 If we plot the solutions to each of these equations separately on the x 1 x 2 -plane, we get two lines, one with negative slope, the other with positive slope. They have exactly one point in common, (x 1 , x 2 ) = (3, -1), which is the solution x 1 = 3, x 2 = -1. From the geometry, we believe that this is the only solution to the system of equations, and so we say it is unique. Now adjust the system with a different second equation, 2 x 1 + 3x 2 = 3 4 x 1 + 6x 2 = 6 A plot of the solutions to these equations individually results in two lines, one on top of the other! There are infinitely many pairs of points that make both equations true. We will learn shortly how to describe this infinite solution set precisely (see Example SAA, Theorem VFSLS). Notice now how the second equation is just a multiple of the first. One more minor adjustment provides a third system of linear equations, 2 x 1 + 3x 2 = 3 4 x 1 + 6x 2 = </passage>"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<tool_call>\\n{\"arguments\": {\"queries\": ['In your opinion, what is the most important aspect of solving systems of linear equations?', 'Do you think geometric representations are helpful in understanding and solving systems of linear equations?

Academic writing in the humanities and social sciences is somewhere in between these two extremes--depending on the subject and context, a writer can make their own choice. Many well-known scholars in these fields use an \"I\" in their academic papers, especially if their connection to the subject \n### \"TO BE\" VERB (IS, ARE, WAS, ETC.) + \n### PAST PARTICIPLE (WALKED, TAKEN, \n### SEEN, ETC.) = PASSIVE VOICE \n A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 206 \n is important to understanding their perspective or point. Some authors use it just a little bit--maybe they open their article with a personal anecdote before moving into a more objective tone--while others use it throughout a piece of writing. It's worth noting that although writing without the \"I\" can be read as more objective, all writing is created by people with perspectives and stances. If I make an argument, it doesn't matter if I frame it with \"I argue\" or not; it's still my argument. From one perspective, then, using an \"I\" voice is simply more transparent about the subjectivity of the work. The \"I\" voice is slightly less formal, although it can still have a place in academic writing. It can also feel quite personal, depending on the subject. Consider the difference between these two sentences: While I recognize the potential value of a longer school day in improving test scores, I don't agree that the benefits are worth the cost. While a longer school day may improve test scores, the benefits aren't worth the cost. How would you describe the difference between these two? You can see how even minor changes like this have an impact on how they \"sound\" to the reader's ear. \n##### Syntax \n The word syntax comes originally from ancient Greek: sun (arrange) and tassein (together) became the Greek word suntaxis. The syntax of a sentence is how it's arranged or how the words are put together. This isn't just a question of correctness; the structure or order of a sentence affects how it strikes its audience. Consider a widespread example from the well-known style guide by Strunk and White. Thomas Paine wrote, \"These are the times that try men's souls.\" How do these rewrites change the impact of the message?  Times like these try men's souls.  How trying it is to live in these times!  These are trying times for men's souls.  Soulwise, these are trying times. As you can see, sentences gain or lose power depending on how they're structured. Longer sentences can seem more formal, but shorter sentences can be more direct and impactful in their own way. Sentences can be combined using semicolons, em dashes, and more; each method will have a slightly different \"feel.\" This can be a fun thing to play around with! Experiment with your own writing by rewriting one sentence in three ways. Which one do you like most? \n##### Tone \n When you were a kid, you may have heard a grown-up say, \"Don't use that tone with me!\" As a parent myself, I have to admit that I have said these words more than I ever imagined I would. 207 COLLECTED WORKS \n When someone says this, they are usually hearing something in your tone--the attitude of your voice--that they don't like. In other words, the way you speak conveys your attitude toward the listener or the situation. The same is true in writing. Tone is the author's attitude toward their subject or their audience. It might be humorous, sarcastic, intimate, distanced, light, serious, warm, cold, subjective, objective, gloomy, cheerful, formal, informal, or something else. This tone comes from word choice (diction), point of view, sentence structure (syntax), and even punctuation. \n##### Formality \n The level of formality in your writing is one important element of tone. This is one of the most obvious differences between a text message and an email to your professor, as we considered above. Academic writing tends to be somewhat formal, although it should still be clear and understandable. Formality is determined by word choice (diction) and sentence structure (syntax). In English, there are often many phrases and words that mean the same thing, but they have different connotations--including their level of formality. Consider the following: The research team will look into these issues. The research team will investigate these issues. Which is more formal? As you can see, word choice has a big impact. Try it for yourself. Can you come up with a more formal substitution for the following phrases?  Come around  Decide  Do tests  Find  Fit in  Futz around  Judge  Make of (as in \"What do you make of it?\")  Pin down  Stick to my position  Read up on  Turn up  Work with A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 208 \n Again, the goal here isn't to change who you are or how you speak. It's about fitting into the genre expectations of whatever you're writing, knowing that your ideas can be more effectively communicated if you adapt to the audience and context. In academic writing, this means making your word choice a bit more formal. The reverse is also true: your friends might roll their eyes if you started texting them with formal academic language! How would you adapt these phrases into a more conversational style?  Examine  Indoctrinate  Interrogate  Probe  Regulate  Resolve  Scrutinize Three more simple ways to adjust the level of formality in your writing: \n**1.** Contractions (can't, don't, it's) are an informal move. You can remove them to     make your writing more formal. However, this is not a strict rule! It's a choice     that you can make as a writer: How formal do you want to be? Are there     times, even in academic writing, where a contraction flows better? \n**2.** Some common transition phrases are inherently formal. Have you ever heard     someone say \"while this may be the case\" or \"therefore\" in casual     conversation?! Only if you have very fancy friends. You can add these to boost     your formality or cut them to make your writing more approachable and     relatable. \n**3.** Exclamation points are also informal. Again, they're not forbidden in     academic writing--but they are infrequent. Use them only with intention and     care to highlight an important point. \n##### Voice \n Imagine you're sitting around with your friends, debating the qualities of a recent Netflix series. Even though you're all talking about the same thing, the way you say things is different: the resonance of your actual voice, of course, but also your word choice, accent, speed, and more. This is true in writing too. In any piece of writing, you can include some of your personal \"voice\" in the piece. Letting yourself shine through often makes a paper more interesting and engaging to read! Voice is the part of your writing that is unique to you as a writer; it's like your fingerprint (or, well, your voice). It comes from word choice, syntax, punctuation, and point of view. 209 COLLECTED WORKS \nVoice is related to tone but slightly different. Voice is about who you are as a writer, while tone is about how you feel about your subject or audience. In other words, my voice is still my own, whether I'm annoyed, charmed, or frazzled. What part of your voice comes through--and how much--might depend on the audience and context of the piece. For that reason, many writers have an academic writing \"persona.\" In other words, writers choose (consciously or unconsciously) to present a particular aspect of their character in an academic setting. That doesn't mean it's fake, but it's how they want to be seen in that context (and is probably not a full view of every part of who they are). Of course, you can imagine how this could _feel_ fake if you are new to academic writing or if academic style asks you to push aside your language background or dialect. Writing personas and voice raise complicated questions about what we expect of writers and students. For example, in writing this chapter, I am writing in a teacherly persona. My voice here is similar to how I would speak in a classroom: warm, friendly, and unpretentious. My tone or attitude toward the subject (style) and the audience (you) is informal and, I hope, encouraging and helpful without being patronizing. The voice I am using here is authentic--it does really feel true to me and who I am--and that's easy for me to achieve after teaching for many years. It's mostly unconscious at this point, but that certainly wasn't the case when I started my career! Even still, this writing voice isn't every part of me. My voice can be sassier--or even raucous!--in a lively text chain with friends, and it's stern in an angry email to my insurance company. However, in all of those scenarios, you can hear me. How I write is always a little different than how you write--and that's a good thing. It makes writing more interesting and engaging to read. One of the best ways to develop your voice is to write a lot. You might try writing a page a day, or reading your own work out loud, or asking a friend to read through your work. Writers have to \"find\" their own voice through time and practice. Ultimately, the goal is to find a balance between yourself and the writing expectations of the genre. Find an academic writing style (or persona) that feels appropriate and--if possible--true to who you are. A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 210 \n**1.** Do you think it's problematic to ask students to write only in standardized     English? Who benefits from this expectation and who is harmed? How     might this expectation impact writers' experience or success in the     classroom or other settings? \n**2.** Vershawn Ashanti Young argues that rather than expecting students to     shift between their personal dialects and dominant (standardized) English,     we should all become \"plurilingual\" in order to better understand and be     open to a mix of dialects. What do you think about this solution? \n**3.** Why is wordiness a problem at a sentence or paragraph level? Why does     this matter, do you think? What is the risk of filling up 10% of your paper     with fluff? How will that change the quality of the final product? \n**4.** How would you describe the tone and voice of this chapter? What writerly     choices impact the tone here? Why do you think I made those choices? Is it     effective? \n#### DISCUSSION QUESTIONS \n211 COLLECTED WORKS \n**1.** Select one paragraph from a paper that you have previously completed (for     this class or another). Revise it for conciseness using the guidelines in this     chapter. What patterns do you notice in your own writing? Which version     of the paragraph do you like better and why? \n**2.** Research one of the following areas of English usage and mechanics, and     then teach it to a small or large group of your peers. Be sure to explain the     rule and why/if it matters. Write two to three good examples and one bad     example of the rule to help your audience understand.

Does the author use an     \"I\" voice? How does this decision affect the tone of the piece? Why might     they have made this writerly choice? \n**4.** Find a recent text chain or social media post that you wrote and \"translate\"     it into more formal, academic language. \n**5.** Take a paragraph from a scholarly article and \"translate\" it into more     informal, conversational language. Which do you think is more effective?     What are some different audiences that might work for both? \n**6.** Select four to five sentences from an article or book that you admire. Now,     try writing your own sentences in the same syntax as the original. In other     words, steal the structure of the sentence, but write about an entirely new     topic. Example: I came, I saw, I conquered. My rewrite: She woke, she     blinked, she sighed. \n**7.** Rewrite each of the following sentences in three different ways (same     content and ideas, just a different order). Which version do you like best? \n#### ACTIVITIES \n A DAM GOOD ARGUMENT 212 \n  She walked the dog past the empty post office, and the dog barked twice.  The soup may be brothy, but it is delicious.

It says: \n1. _If_ a predicate is true for a certain number, \n2. _and_ its being true for some number would reliably mean that     it's also true for the next number ( _i.e._ , one number greater), \n3. _then_ it's true for all numbers. \nAll you have to do is prove those two things, and you've effectively proven it for every case. \nThe first step is called the **base case** , and the \"certain number\" we pick is normally either 0 or 1. The second step, called the **inductive step** , is where all the trouble lies. You have to look really, really carefully at how it's worded, above. We are _not_ assuming \n234 CHAPTER 9. PROOF \nthat the predicate is true for any old number! We are simply considering, _if_ it's true for any old number, whether that would necessarily imply it's also true for the next number. In terms of the predicate, we're asking \"does P(k) imply P(k +1)?\" In other words: \"we aren't sure if P(k) is true. But if it is -- a big \"if,\" of course -- would that logically demand that P(k + 1) was also true?\" If you can prove that it does, then you're in business. \nThe whole thing is set up like a row of dominos. If one domino falls, then the one after it will also fall. And if that one falls, then so will the next. All that is needed is a base case to tip over the first domino, and by this trail of causality, _all_ the dominos will fall. \nOne terminology note: the entire second step is called the inductive step, but the first half of it (the part where we assume that P(k) is true) is called the **inductive hypothesis**. We never prove the inductive hypothesis; rather, we assume it, and then see if that allows us to deduce that P(k + 1) would also be true. \n**Example 1** \nLet's work this out for the drinking/voting example. Let Vote(n) be the proposition that a citizen of age n can vote. Our proof goes like this: \n1. **base case.** Vote(21) is true, because a 21-year old is old     enough to vote in the state and national elections. \n2. **inductive step.** Vote(k)=Vote(k+1). Why? Because     nobody's gettin' any younger. If you can vote in a particular     year, then you're also old enough to vote next year. Unless     the laws change, there will never be a case when someone old     enough to vote this year turns out to be too young to vote     next year. \n3. **conclusion.** Wow. n >= 21 Vote(n). We're done. _Q.E.D._     and all that. \nThe only specific example we showed was true was Vote(21). And yet we managed to prove Vote(n) for _any_ number n >= 21. \n9.3. PROOF BY INDUCTION 235 \nLet's look back at that inductive step, because that's where all the action is. It's crucial to understand what that step does _not_ say. It doesn't say \"Vote(k) is true for some number k.\" If it did, then since k's value is arbitrary at that point, we would basically be assuming the very thing we were supposed to prove, which is circular reasoning and extremely unconvincing. But that's not what we did. Instead, we made the inductive hypothesis and said, \"okay then, let's assume for a second a 40-year-old can vote. We don't know for sure, but let's say she can. Now, if that's indeed true, can a 41-year-old also vote? The answer is yes.\" We might have said, \"okay then, let's assume for a second a 7-year-old can vote. We don't know for sure, but let's say she can. Now, if that's indeed true, can an 8-year-old also vote? The answer is yes.\" Note carefully that we did _not_ say that 8-year-olds can vote! We merely said that _if_ 7-year-olds can, why then 8-year-olds must be able to as well. Remember that X=Y is true if either X is false or Y is true (or both). In the 7/8-year-old example, the premise X turns out to be false, so this doesn't rule out our implication. \nThe result is a row of falling dominos, up to whatever number we wish. Say we want to verify that a **25-year-old** can vote. Can we be sure? Well: \n1. If a 24-year-old can vote, then that would sure prove it (by     the inductive step). \n2. So now we need to verify that a 24-year-old can vote. Can he?     Well, if a 23-year-old can vote, then that would sure prove it     (by the inductive step). \n3. Now everything hinges on whether a 23-year-old can vote.     Can he? Well, if a 22-year-old can vote, then that would sure     prove it (by the inductive step). \n4. So it comes down to whether a 22-year-old can vote. Can he?     Well, if a 21-year-old can vote, then that would sure prove it     (by the inductive step). \n5. And now we need to verify whether a 21-year-old can vote.     Can he? Yes (by the base case). \n236 CHAPTER 9. PROOF \n**Example 2** \nA famous story tells of Carl Friedrich Gauss, perhaps the most brilliant mathematician of all time, getting in trouble one day as a schoolboy. As punishment, he was sentenced to tedious work: adding together all the numbers from 1 to 100. To his teacher's astonishment, he came up with the correct answer in a moment, not because he was quick at adding integers, but because he recognized a trick. The first number on the list (1) and the last (100) add up to 101. So do the second number (2) and the second-to-last (99). So do 3 and 98, and so do 4 and 97, _etc._ , all the way up to 50 and \n51. So really what you have here is 50 different sums of 101 each, so the answer is 50 x 101 = 5050. In general, if you add the numbers from 1 to x, where x is any integer at all, you'll get x 2 sums of x + 1 \neach, so the answer will be x(x 2 +1). \nNow, use mathematical induction to prove that Gauss was right \n( _i.e._ , that \n x i=1 \n i = x(x 2 +1) ) for all numbers x. \nFirst we have to cast our problem as a predicate about natural numbers. This is easy: we say \"let P(n) be the proposition that ^ n \ni=1 \n i = n(n 2 +1) .\" \nThen, we satisfy the requirements of induction: \n1. **base case.** We prove that P(1) is true simply by plugging it     in. Setting n = 1 we have \n ^1 \n i=1 \n i = 1(1 + 1)? 2 \n 1 = 1(2)? 2 1 = 1 X \n2. **inductive step.** We now must prove that P(k)=P(k + 1).     Put another way, we _assume_ P(k) is true, and then use that     assumption to prove that P(k + 1) is also true. \n9.3. PROOF BY INDUCTION 237 \n Let's be crystal clear where we're going with this. Assuming that P(k) is true means we can count on the fact that \n 1 + 2 + 3 + * * * + k = \n k(k + 1) 2 . \n What we need to do, then, is prove that P(k + 1) is true, which amounts to proving that \n 1 + 2 + 3 + * * * + (k + 1) = ( \n k + 1)((k + 1) + 1) 2 . \n Very well. First we make the inductive hypothesis, which allows us to assume: \n 1 + 2 + 3 + * * * + k = k(k + 1) 2 \n . \n The rest is just algebra. We add k + 1 to both sides of the equation, then multiply things out and factor it all together. Watch carefully: \n 1 + 2 + 3 + * * * + k + (k + 1) = k(k + 1) 2 \n + (k + 1) \n = 1 2 k^2 + 1 2 k + k + 1 \n = 1 2 k^2 + 3 2 k + 1 \n = \n k^2 + 3k + 2 2 = ( \n k + 1)(k + 2) 2 = ( \n k + 1)((k + 1) + 1) 2 \n. X \n3. **conclusion.** Therefore, n >= 1 P(n). \n**Example 3** \nAnother algebra one. You learned in middle school that (ab)n^ = anbn. Prove this by mathematical induction. \nSolution: Let P(n) be the proposition that (ab)n^ = anbn. \n238 CHAPTER 9. PROOF \n1. **base case.** We prove that P(1) is true simply by plugging it     in. Setting n = 1 we have \n (ab)^1 =? a^1 b^1 ab = ab X \n2. **inductive step.** We now must prove that P(k)=P(k + 1).     Put another way, we _assume_ P(k) is true, and then use that     assumption to prove that P(k + 1) is also true.     Let's be crystal clear where we're going with this. Assuming     that P(k) is true means we can count on the fact that \n (ab)k^ = akbk. \n What we need to do, then, is prove that P(k + 1) is true, which amounts to proving that \n (ab)k+1^ = ak+1bk+1. \n Now we know by the very definition of exponents that: \n (ab)k+1^ = ab(ab)k. \n Adding in our inductive hypothesis then lets us determine: \n (ab)k+1^ = ab(ab)k = ab * akbk = a * ak^ * b * bk = ak+1bk+1^ X \n3. **conclusion.** Therefore, n >= 1 P(n). \n9.3. PROOF BY INDUCTION 239 \n**Example 4** \nLet's switch gears and talk about structures. Prove that the number of leaves in a perfect binary tree is one more than the number of internal nodes. \nSolution: let P(n) be the proposition that a perfect binary tree of height n has one more leaf than internal node. That is, if lk is the number of _l_ eaves in a tree of height k, and ik is the number of _i_ nternal nodes in a tree of height k, let P(n) be the proposition that ln = in + 1. \n1. **base case.** We prove that P(0) is true simply by inspection.     If we have a tree of height 0, then it has only one node (the     root). This sole node is a leaf, and is not an internal node. So     this tree has 1 leaf, and 0 internal nodes, and so l 0 = i 0 + 1.     X \n2. **inductive step.** We now must prove that P(k)=P(k + 1).     Put another way, we _assume_ P(k) is true, and then use that     assumption to prove that P(k + 1) is also true.     Let's be crystal clear where we're going with this. Assuming     that P(k) is true means we can count on the fact that \n lk = ik + 1. \n What we need to do, then, is prove that P(k + 1) is true, which amounts to proving that \n lk+1 = ik+1 + 1. \n We begin by noting that the number of nodes on level k of a perfect binary tree is 2 k. This is because the root is only one node, it has two children (giving 2 nodes on level 1), both those children have two children (giving 4 nodes on level 2), all four of those children have two children (giving 8 nodes on level 3), etc. Therefore, lk = 2k, and lk+1 = 2k+1. Further, we observe that ik+1 = ik + lk: this is just how trees work. In words, suppose we have a perfect binary tree of \n240 CHAPTER 9. PROOF \n height k, and we add another level of nodes to it, making it a perfect binary tree of height k + 1. Then all of the first tree's nodes (whether internal or leaves) become internal nodes of bigger tree. Combining these two facts, we have ik+1 = ik + 2k. By the inductive hypothesis, we assume that 2 k^ = ik + </passage>"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<tool_call>\\n{\"arguments\": {\"queries\": ['Can you explain the difference between a base case and an inductive hypothesis in mathematical induction?', 'How does the inductive step in mathematical induction differ from the inductive hypothesis?', 'Can you provide an example of how the inductive step is used in mathematical induction?'], \"name\": \"ExpertQAExtractor\"}}\\n</tool_call>"}]}
